51,3 May 2020,burkebuilder,Brightburn (2019),1.0,"No good place to start a review for a bad movie like this. A bad cross between Superman and the Oman. A kid comes from space and crash lands on a farm (parents know this).Strange things start to happen involving him, but the parents don't seem to think it's a big deal. This movie lost me there. How can you have a son from space and not think he's capable of unusual conduct?Seems ***like some college kids got drunk and wrote*** an ""idea"" for a movie, then had some parents in good with a movie producer who gave this nonsense the green light to make. I'm so tired of bad movies that are total rip offs with a silly, cliche twist.",True
73,3 May 2020,contact-125-651146,Charade (1963),9.0,"An excellent cast: Cary Grant (in an superb performance), Katherine Hepburn, Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy. All of them giving us a great performance.
***Like the trailer of this movie said***: suspense, comedy, and romance. All of them in perfect balance. I would include action.
Nothing went wrong on this movie.
and we can't forget the soundtrack, composed by Henry Mancini.
I can't understand why this movie and Cary Grant didn't get any Oscar nomination except the soundtrack.
The main title was made famous by bhave being sung by Andy Williams although his performance didn't appear in the movie.",True

Its just so hilarious that this was made by the same guy who made ""Joshua and the Promised Land"" (the movie). ***Like Saberspark said***, although you would expect this animator to get better after the catastrophe that was Joshua and the Promised Land in 2003, guess what? He did not.",True
664,4 May 2020,schroederagustavo,BioShock Infinite (2013 Video Game),8.0,"The world is beautiful, the characters are likeable, it's similar enough to the original game to feel like it's a part of the same franchise, yet different enough to be its own thing, it's a really good game. I thought the ending didn't make much sense at first, but I think it helps to play the DLC, which is very much worth playing as well. It's still confusing as hell, but it makes more sense if you play that. The game looks great (even in 2020) and it plays wonderfully, the gameplay is very dynamic and very cool. I love Elizabeth as a character, she's likeable and she's incredibly useful in the game (perhaps even too useful, since I never ran out of ammo in the game). And she is officially the hottest character in video game history, as far as I'm concerned. Even her voice is sexy as hell! Anyway, there are a few things, especially towards the end of the game that I wasn't in love with, like the ghost creatures that attack you reaching the final level, I still thing that's pretty weird and probably doesn't make much sense. ***Like I said***, the DLC is sweet and it changes things up quite a bit, especially in part 2, which is pretty much a stealth game (and it's really good).",True
794,4 May 2020,mossfan18,Weathering with You (2019),8.0,"First off, I think it's the most beautifully animated anime film I've ever seen. Simply breathtaking.The soundtrack was fantastic and the acting was great.My only gripe was how similar it was to Your Name.
It's ***like they said*** to themselves ""Your Name"" was a hit, so let's follow that format exactly.Similarities I saw:Teenage love
2 different backgrounds, Big city and small town
Wise cracking younger sibling
The ""will they ever see eachother again?"" Pause
The reunion ending at an older ageGranted I really enjoyed it, but it lacked originality to me. I'll watch the English dub when it comes out.Still totally worth anyone's time!",True

1180,24 February 2020,munrogmclaren,"Supergirl: It's a Super Life (2020) Season 5, Episode 13",10.0,"This episode was truly amazing. I loved seeing all the different timelines. I'm glad that kara was able to see different outcomes if she had made different decisions.In the two we do see Lena come around in the end. In the first one, Kara died in the first one because Lena couldn't save her in time. Though I did love how Sam made sure Lena and o think even the audience knew that Lena was a hero and not a villain when she saved same and made kryptonite. Also, Kara yelled out to the TV that Lena was a villain and how could she think that and then at the end said Lena will be treated like a villain which showed me the ending scene was to get Lena to snap out of it. Kara truly doesn't think Lena is a villain. But she has the capacity to be one.In the second one, Lena died after Reign killed her, it showed that Lena will come around in the end even if it truly doesn't seem like she will. Seeing Lena die in Kara's arms was horrible. And if you notice closely, her last words are, ""Kara."" Then Mon-El went on a rampage and killed Sam while in turn getting killed himself. And Kara told Mxy to bring her back.The third one has go to be my favorite. It really showcases how it would be like if Kara and Lena a Super and a Luthor were working together. Though, I don't think Agent Liberty killing off all her friends was the right way to go. I think there could have been different outcomes. Also, why did the public have to know that Lena knew Supergirl's identity. If they didn't, I think this timeline would have played out differently. But anyways, the third timeline didn't work as well. Though it was my favorite.
I have to say, I liked Mon-El's advice to Kara regarding Lena. I hope it sticks with her.Regarding the ending, it was needed to be said. Lena's worst fear is becoming the villain and ***like Kara said***, if Lena continues down this path, she will have now choice but to treat her like one. Kara wasn't calling Lena a villain at the moment. But, having Lena hear this from her (ex) best friend, has got to hurt. I definitely think we will see Lena second guessing herself in the upcoming episodes. Robert Rovner abd Jessica Queller, Supergirl's showrunners, did an interview with Entertainment Weekly and Rovner said that we will see Lena second guessing herself and contemplating what she's doing.I truly don't think Lena will go through with Non Nocere. Yes, I know in 5x14 she moves forward with it. But who's to say at the end of the episode she stops herself? She'll have to do it quietly though because Lex definitely has plans for Non Nocere.So yes, I do think by the end of the season, Lena will have come around or be close to fully coming around. Rovner said they (Kara and Lena) will come full circle at the end end of the season. So that's my hope. That they will become friends again. This interview just cemented it.10/10 episode. Great performances by all! I loved seeing all the cameos! I've missed Odette so much! Sam was a very missed character. I'm sad Calista want able to make her schedule work to appear in the episode, but I'm glad they referenced her.I'm hopeful for the rest of the season. :)",True

But the humor is sometimes completely horrible in this episode. ***Like they said*** inTHIS episode: ""You gotta choose your moment"". If only they had applied this rule while writing the episode, it could have been so much better.",True
1993,24 February 2020,MovieBuff11732,The Call of the Wild (2020),8.0,"The Call Of The Wild is about a dog who is taken away from his family and taken to the UCON as a sled dog. When he goes there he is bumped back and fourth from many people until he gets to one man who really loves him. They go on an adventure together and go through many hard things.The Call Of The Wild is probably the best family movie of the year so far. I liked this movie. I thought it was more charming than a bunch of family movies. That is mainly do to Harrison Ford's performance. If it was another man playing his part it just wouldn't have been as good as it turned out to be. I thought all of the acting was good. The story was a little shaky I thought. The start of the movie wasn't as exciting or as good as a start should be. It didn't really grab your attention right out of the gate. The rest of the story besides besides the villain was solid. I just thought the villain was weak and I couldn't really relate to him that much. ***Like I said***, besides that the story was good. The CGI is something many people are talking about. There was a lot of it in this film. Exceptionally the animals in this film. They looked extremely shiny and cartoonish. There was some really stunning CGI but it wouldn't really feel like they were in the wild. It made me feel like the film is on a stage. They couldn't get me ensured enough to feel like I was actually in the great outdoors. Another thing I enjoyed is the score. It added some of the charm to this film. It was happy and intense when it needed to be. This is the only other film I could think of to use a banjo in its score besides Raising Arizona. I enjoyed that about this film.Overall, The Call Of The Wild was a fun film that I would recommend for families or readers of the book.",True
2511,1 September 2020,KatyKat99,Hoops (2020),10.0,"Honestly I'm sure I'm prejudice as hell but I loved this show. I've never actually watched a whole season of one of these types of shows (😬) like I usually just don't get it. God, my friend had a fit when I said I didn't ***like Rick and Morty, or Archer, but Rick and Morty was fu¢king gross (Someone said*** I should start with Pickle Rick and I literally had nightmares yes I'm a sissy) and Archer, I really didn't give much of a chance after his mom was torturing him naked (ew). But this show starred one of my vary favorite actors of all time, and if I'm completely honest he portrayed one of the first tv characters I had a crush on. Yep, when I was like 13 I thought Nick Miller from new girl was the best tv boyfriend (truthfully it him was and Captain Hook from OUAT but I digress). So once I saw this show on Netflix I was excited, but also sad because there was no way I could watch this and actually like it, but I did! For the most part, like it had plenty of ew moments but overall I really liked it. Probably not 10 stars worth but the rating being so low made me sad, I really wanted to know what happens!
Edit: Re: I'm a sissy. There was an episode with a horse I had to skip. It really freaked me out which was a shame bc that episode had Schmidt (Max Greenfield) from New Girl too and I was HYPED.",True
2524,1 September 2020,tangsengbros,Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood (2019),10.0,"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino's ninth film also his latest. It tells the story of two Hollywood stars struggling to recapture fame and success in 1960s Los Angeles.I've got to say this is the film that Tarantino should be making at this time of his career. I've seen all of his films and I might say that I know his taste to filmmaking by now. The film doesn't feel like it was made in 2019, it felt like it's a film that was made in the 60s and released in today.This is a laid-back film where characters just hang out, sit down and talk regarding their days. The film shows how much Tarantino loves that era of Hollywood. I can see it in the film. I love how he approaches movies. I love his thoughts on filmmaking. That's why he's by far on my top 3 best directors' list.Easily, the Best part of this movie is Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) I mean he's really great in this movie it added so much to the movie. Rick Dalton is also great... (Leonardo Dicaprio) Margot Robbie... everyone works, I love the casting. Leo and Brad made this movie so elevated. For me, almost every scene and every line are rememberable. Seriously seeing Al Pacino doing a machine gun impression blows my mind, I laughed so hard. It was such a great scene in the trailer.The Soundtracks... I LOVE IT! If you're doing a review for the movie without mentioning the soundtracks... You have failed my friend... you have failed. Haha, I'm kidding but in all honesty, the soundtracks also added something to the movie. The movie almost feels different without it.In my mind, I truly believed that the Characters of Rick and Cliff actually existed. Tarantino does a very great job of helming all the characters by putting them in weird situations. I've seen the film many times. Without exaggeration, I would say about 6-9 times. I can remember some of the lines that are in this film... that's when you know a film is great.That is a lot of scenes where characters just hang around and talk and ""***like Chris Stuckmann (film critic) said***"" there are scenes where Leo and Brad's character just sit down and watch an episode of TV show that they've worked on and the entire shot is just the TV and we're watching an episode of a TV show that they're in and they're waiting to appear and you hear their commentary in the background is truly amazing. That would not work as well if weren't for those two actors.I've been a film geek since I was young and I was also inspired by Quentin Tarantino ever since I saw Pulp Fiction. I remember this quote he said in an interview, ""You don't have to know how to make a movie... if you truly love Cinema, with all of your hearts... then you can't help but to make a good movie"" That's it that inspired me to be a filmmaker.Quentin Tarantino is a legend when it comes to making movies. The guy knows everything about filmmaking and you can see within his films. Some people might not enjoy this film, my friends didn't like it. They were disappointed after they saw it. But I didn't I adored this film in every way I can. I LOVE everything there is about this film. Everything in this film went beyond my expectation when I saw the trailer. In the trailer, it seems like it's just a collection of cool consequences. I roared in the third act. It's amazing, especially with a song that fits the situation which I won't spoil.In conclusion, this is Quentin Tarantino's love letter to filmmaking and Hollywood in that era. It's a very fun, cool laid-back film, thank you, Quentin, it's an honour to be able to see your vision, your ideas and what you have to say about filmmaking and storytelling. Definitely check the film out give it a try if you haven't. Doesn't matter if you're a fan of Tarantino or just a person who enjoys movies.Thank you Quentin... thank you.""You don't have to know how to make a movie...... if you truly love Cinema, with all of your hearts... then you can't help but to make a good movie"" Quentin Tarantino",True
2771,1 September 2020,chaswe-28402,Robin Hood (2010),3.0,"Was this a joke ? Crowe and Ridley playing Monty Python ? The feeble French invasion turned to D Day in reverse. Same landing craft, however. The English arrows over the grey cliffs of Dungeness (cliffs? Dungeness is as flat as a pancake) didn't help the French to fight in the shade. Didn't King John actually sign Magna Carta at Runnymede ? But here it looked like he set it alight. Wasn't Marion a maid, not a missus ? I thought Robin robbed the rich to help the poor. Not here. So Richard didn't make it back to England to say hello to Errol ? Sorry Ridley. You've got it all wrong. The real Robin Hood always rode through the green and pleasant woodland, dressed in Lincoln Green, with his merry men, shooting deer and sheriffs, splitting arrows, fluently trouncing dastards, feared by the bad, loved by the good. Scouting ahead was nobody's fool, the well-employed Jester, with the brew that is true; and by his side was the glorious Maid Marion de Havilland, in brilliant sun-drenched colour. Wikipedia reveals this production to have been a stonking disaster, end to end. I didn't actually see the French king surrendering to Crowe, ***like somebody said***, but there you go. How come von Sydow got a Beowulf-type Viking send-off ? Some good visuals, but not one of Ridley's best. I'd say his worst.",True
3039,24 August 2013,ironhorse_iv,Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986),8.0,"Honestly I felt that this was more Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck)'s movie than Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) because nothing about Ferris is a coming of age story character arch. Ferris Bueller just end up being just Ferris Bueller by the end of the film, while Cameron grows as a character. This comedy movie written, produced and directed by John Hughes tells the story of Ferris Bueller who decides to skip school and spend the day in downtown Chicago, while not getting catch by Dean of Students Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) or Ferris' sarcastic sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) . It's just another day in the life of Ferris Bueller. While, normal fans think that the movie is just that. A simple plot. Others think, the events of the day are really happening in Cameron Frye's mind. Ferris Bueller and even Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) might just be made up in Cameron's mind to feel the void of no- friends. This might be taken serious due to the fact that Cameron is clearly older (Ruck was 29 playing 17) have no girlfriend, lonely, and has a control freak of a father. Ferris is the total opposite of Cameron: he's fun, spontaneous and has a loving family and sexy girlfriend. I don't really like Ferris due to his unrealistic nature. Truly he is unsympathetic prodigal son, leaping out of the nest at breakneck speed with flagrant disregard to everything except his own inner pleasure-seeker without judgment. It's Cameron that is the punching bag of events, taking all the risk. While, Ferris act sick to get out of school, Cameron is sick. This theory explains the more fantastic elements of the film such as the breaking of the fourth wall or unexplained events. For example, the whole city of Chicago rallies around the sick Ferris. This represents Cameron's dejected home life and how he yearns for people to care for him. This might also might represent what Cameron thinks the ""popular"" kids at school are like. The world revolves around them. Most of the film has Cameron wearing a medical insignia t-shirt. By the end of the film, the medical insignia, is inside out. Perhaps saying he doesn't need the medical help anymore, he has set himself on the path to correcting his life and facing his father. This film might be a comedy, but it's a thinking man comedy. There was the odd scene with Cameron was fixated on the little girl in Georges Seurat's 'A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte' painting. Does it any deeper meaning or just pointless. Cameron might see his life in pointillism, a technique of painting using small dots, hence the zoom in. That's kind of a discouraging thought. Unless, perhaps this was Cameron's mental journey towards understanding. In a way, that really works with this theory. The closer you look at the movie, the more everything looks like abstract blemishes on the fabric of Cameron's mind. When you're just observing the movie without thinking too deeply about it, it's just Ferris and his friends having a day running around Chicago. But the closer you look, the less things appear to be what we're shown. Actually, even before I did notice near the end that Ferris and Cameron had a bit of a role reversal when the car went over the edge. In that scene, Ferris, the always calm confident guy was scared and Cameron stepped up as the calm confident guy. Almost as though there was a momentary persona swap as though Cameron where beginning to reconcile himself, drawing Ferris strengths into himself and offloading his weaknesses into Ferris. Fascinating. Anyway, it's a cute theory, though probably not what John Hughes had in mind. The humor is so funny that it is often parody or use in other movies. The acting from all the cast is spot on. This movie is a tour guide of Chicago as it feature many famous Chicago landmarks including the then Sears Tower, Wrigley Field and the Art Institute of Chicago. I like how Wrigley Field had a Ferris Bueller's Day game in 2011. John Hughes wanted to film a scene where Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron go to a strip club. Paramount scrapped it. Honestly, that would have made the movie way more interesting than it supposed to have. I love the 1961 Ferrari GT California. I hope to get one, one day to drive around Chicago. Things I didn't like about the film: no character development for Ferris. All fun, but no work ethic. It might be telling kids, it's OK to have fun, it's not like you have to work a little to have that fun. I dig the ""Danke Schoen"" and ""Twist and Shout"" songs, just not the over the top parade scene. It felt too cheesy. I did like the 'Oh Yeah' song as well. The soundtrack is amazing. The movie was so popular, it got a short live TV show in 1990's with a then unknown Jennifer Aniston, a 2011's documentary and even an Super Bowl commercial in 2012. Overall: it has the spirit of effortless escapism. ***Like Ferris Bueller said*** on his day off, ""Find the joy in life, because Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it!'"" So don't miss out on seeing this film.",True
3058,24 August 2013,votesmall,Swindle (2013 TV Movie),1.0,"There are some adaptations that can get away with omitting and changing some parts from the book it is based on. For example, Jurassic Park, I Am Legend and Jaws make pretty major changes from the source material but does so in a fashion that maintains the overall structure, style and message. Gordon Korman's ""Swindle"" one of my absolute favorite books, but the adaptation of Swindle is horrendous. This film is by far the worst film adaptation I have EVER seen. Not only was Swindle one of the best damn books ever written, but everything in the book worked in a way that made total sense. The movie barely retains the structure of the book it is based on. This would be forgivable if Swindle was 400 pages long, like Jurassic Park or the Lord of the Rings. Obviously you need to omit some material. BUT Swindle was a modest length children's book, so why this movie felt the need to make ridiculous amounts of unreasonable and senseless changes to the PERFECT book. I'm not some twelve year old writing this review, and I'm not acting ***like everything Gordon Korman wrote*** was a masterpiece, but when Korman got it right, he got it right. Why even make an adaptation of one of the greatest children's novels ever made when you won't do it right? I'm sixteen nearing my seventeenth birthday and I can firmly say that Swindle is one of the greatest children's books ever written. It knows its audience, has a great structure, original plot, refrains from clichés, flamboyant, developed characters and a realistic method of retrieving the card. This film has neither the charisma of the novel nor its intelligence. EXAMPLES: 1) In the book, S. Wendell actually fools them into selling the card to him by explaining that it is a worthless replica. In the film, they need as MUCH MONEY AS THEY CAN GET because Ben (not Griffin) is moving to Montana. Also for some reason a hole is punched into a wall and they need cash fast to cover the costs. So when they sell it to Swendell not only is it painfully obvious to our ignoramus protagonists (in the book they were intelligent and likable) that Swendell is lying but he later actually admits that, get this, HE WAS LYING!!! He then raises the price from $10 to a shattering sum of $350. Obviously knowing that Swendell can't be trusted, our protagonists cleverly look up the price of the card and discover its true value, right? WRONG. They, despite knowing it is worth more than Swendell said, they ACTUALLY SELL IT TO HIM. In the book our protagonists were intelligent and only were fooled because S. Wendell was confident and actually sounded like he knew what he was talking about. 2) One of the biggest changes comes from making Griffin from a regular whiz-kid into a suave and stuck-up cool kid. Also, Ben's dad is the inventor and Ben (whose narcolepsy is taken out) is the one moving. Also instead of being a practical fruit picker for farmers, the invention turns out to be a lame extending arm made for lazy people who can't get their ass off the couch to turn off the lights or grab the remote. The characters are also made to be in their late teens as opposed to middle schoolers in the book. Swindell is also made to be an incompetent and irrational monster (he pushed a nun down a steep hill) as opposed to the selfish and sneaky character of the book who was too intelligent to do something like that. The character of the book was also a great liar whereas the character of the film is such a terrible liar that anyone with an IQ over 40 would realize they were being screwed over. The character's names, genders, specialties and dialogue are changed beyond belief but perhaps the BIGGEST flaw is when they change the final heist from S. Wendell's house to a CROWDED EXHIBIT HALL. Instead of being a fresh and suspenseful heist from a house in the middle of the night it goes from being a predictable heist in a crowded hotel ballroom. 3)There are THREE Call Me Maybe references. In the final scene, Darren and Savannah sing Call Me Maybe. What was the point of this? Nothing, nothing at all. But while the book will still hold up in three hundred years, the movie will be dated. 4) The ending of the book taught us that money doesn't matter as long as you have friends. Here they sell the card and each of the talentless group members actually get $25,000. The movie literally spat on the book.To say I was disappointed by this film is an understatement. And you may criticize me for comparing the two works but think of it this way: Perfection cannot be topped unless you are going to at least try to replicate the original. This film DOESN'T EVEN TRY. A childish, predictable, preposterous, unrealistic, rushed and overall boring film that tried to capitalize on one of the greatest books for children ever written. Did you like the Cat in the Hat? If so, this film is probably for you. But if you DIDN'T because a simple morality tale from Dr. Seuss was superior to Mike Myers in a cat suit, you WOULDN'T like this slapstick bullshit film adaptation, mainly because THERE IS NO STRUCTURE. It happens SO FAST and there is no challenge for our protagonists. I barely realized this was based off Swindle, because it was so untrue to the book (which is a good thing if done correctly) but it was childish and mind-numbing to watch. I wish this movie hadn't been made. Gordon Korman and anyone over the age of six would HATE this movie for not even trying to relate to its target audience or tell the story in an effective and suspenseful manner, as the book did so well.",True
3126,24 August 2013,omendata,Zombie Massacre (2013),3.0,"It was bad very bad - the acting was utterly ridiculous it was almost like a comedy and the lines ""so many wars , so many women"" they truly have to be heard to be believed almost every scene there was a monstrously bad piece of dialogue ""You know what a big pile of Shiite with flies around it looks like , I'm going to create a big pile of Shiite"" - That was one of the more witty lines of dialogue! I am not joking you really really really have to see this for the dialogue - virtually every line was cringe-worthy.The main actor was about as dull as Mr Dull McDull from the town of Drab On The Island Of Very Very Tedious. Great name ""Jack Stone"" - I wonder how many movies have used this combo of hard nut naming convention? I can only presume he was hired not due to his miniscule acting talent but massive manly frame to go with the equally manly hard-nut name!As for the female sword wielding ninja mute - oh words evade me just watch it and you will see what i mean!To be fair the Scottish guy was actually quite funny with lines ***like ""gonna slow it down chief I'm getting old"" said*** in that pithy Glaswegian drawl - I am still not sure whether this was by design or pure fluke or perhaps because I empathise with a fellow Glaswegian forced to take part in this carousel of calamity?Zombie make-up was actually quite good but the whole thing was a disaster and more of a comedy than a serious Zombie flick - view it as a comedy and you might make it through the 1 and a half odd hours of torture!!!I am giving it three stars just because of the funny Scots mercenary!!! He deserves a badge for making it through this movie as do I!!! Was it meant to be funny and ironic - who knows but it has seriously messed with my head!!!",True
3321,25 August 2013,patsworld,We're the Millers (2013),8.0,"Okay, my expectations for We're the Millers wasn't too high when I went to see it. And granted, some of it is overly crude and too gross, but a lot of it is laugh out loud funny, too. This is not a movie that's going to win any awards, but it is not a bad movie if you just want to be entertained for an hour or soand are not a kid. This is not a movie for kids, but for grownups who aren't the sort to be put off by a few of the scenes, it's a funny film. And I don't suppose those folks are going to be interested in seeing a picture like this anyway, so.. At any rate, it's refreshing to see something that isn't geared to the teenage mindset, brimming over with vampires, or moronic party, party, party time, or the sort slam-bang full of non-stop violence as to make your head hurt, so that I quite enjoyed myself for the most part. ***Like I said***, a few scenes I could have done without but then, nobody asked me about the content, or how to present it, when it was filmed. Jennifer Aniston continues to prove what a delight she is. She's one of the few actresses who appeal to both male and female viewers. The males for obvious reasons and the females because , although she is gorgeous, it's the rare version of beauty that isn't threatening because she IS so very likable. The perfect star for a comedy movie. And Jason Sudeikis is terrific. Just perfect for comedy and yet has the ability to carry serious moments equally as well. This had a fun plot, if one can get past the drug-running aspect of it, and after all, it's only a movie, so why not? Had some good music with Will Poulter, who played the 'son' super doing his thing to Waterfall. All in all, better than you'd expect and a dandy opportunity for some laughs.",True
3344,25 August 2013,Stompgal_87,My Dog Tulip (2009),8.0,"As a lover of dogs and animation, I found this film appealing. It is a perfect example that combines the two alongside '101 Dalmatians,' 'Oliver and Company,' 'The Plague Dogs' and pretty much any incarnation of 'Scooby Doo,' although the animation style of this film differs from that of all four of the titles since it has a sketchy if wobbly look. Most of the animation was smooth but jerky on the chickens and the backgrounds were as sketchy as the characters and both had rather subtle colours if the fantasy sequences on paper were plain and simple.The narrative of this film was engaging and reminiscent of 'Marley and Me.' I liked how Joe's typing or handwriting fitted in with it as well as the fantasy sequences depicting Tulip and other dogs in anthropomorphic ways on lined or plain sketch paper while the music had an old-fashioned feel that suited the film's style very well. Although some parts of it were crude and disgusting (especially Joe cleaning up Tulip's runny mess in the middle of the night - it nearly made me vomit) and risqué (no wonder it's a UK 12 rating), I was touched by the unlikely relationship of Joe and Tulip. Although she was a live-wire and seemed to be more interested in his sister Nancy, he still loved her. Parts of the film reminded me of when my parents owned a dog themselves such as Tulip dragging her bottom on the floor with her hind legs in the air (probably what dogs do when they need to relieve themselves) and going on heat since I observed Jasmine (my parents' Cavalier King Charles spaniel that they acquired in 2008 but was sadly returned to her breeder in 2011) dragging her bottom on the floor and my dad suggesting she needed a wee as well as her moments of going on heat. While the pace of the film was pretty slow until Tulip had her puppies, it was at this point that it became rushed because it seemed ***like little or no time between the birth of Tulip's puppies and her death (mentioned*** but not seen: only depicted as her fading away and returning as an anthropomorphic spirit). I like the fact that this film was dedicated to Lynn Redgrave since it was her final film before her unfortunate passing.All in all this is an obscure yet distinctively-animated film that has its blend of crude, risqué and touching moments and is easier to follow than 'The Plague Dogs'. 8/10.",True

3895,26 August 2013,Reno-Rangan,Kick-Ass 2 (2013),8.0,"I took time to review this movie after the watch. This movie was not what I expected, you know what the first installment was better than this sequel. This 'Kick-ass 2' had so many jokes which are adult comedies, sometime those were too disgusting especially the puking one, ew. Don't forget the powerful gangster Mark Strong, the villain of the first movie, that led the movie to its success. But in this part, there are many villains and too weak in strength, I think except the 'Mother Russia'. And other villains are hyped too much for their strength in the intro then they were no way near to as what they were supposed to. Too many bad words used in this movie compared to first which makes not a family and kids friendly movie, just like the 'Scary movie'. Of course it was R rated movie, just for your information.The Jim Carrey's role was small but liked though expected lots more from him. When it comes to the story, it was not that great but okayish type, remember I loved first part story very much. 'Kick-Ass' was one of my favourite action movie, the end fights were breathtaking especially the bazooka and flying thing they used. In this story there are too many characters that use superhero costumes and too many superhero names which sometimes looks like some Halloween party. The main character 'Kick-Ass' was slightly disappears when other costume characters in action, that's so disappointing. On the other side of the story the 'Hit-Girl' meets 'Mean Girls' and that's an off the track of what this movie is supposed to be. Chloe was excellent, she was a little girl at first, now in this she has grown up and for the next she will be a woman. There was no time for character developments, totally randomized in its appearances, except the Mindy who gets the cooled portion of the movie but slightly drags her role with 'Mean Girls' stuff.We can say this movie is kind of an American version of 'Crow Zero' with men and women in fancy dresses. This movie keeps you alive because of its adult comedies and of course the awesome stunts. I liked the movie but not as much of its first part. I felt somewhere between two movies the bridge misled us. Better the third one should be very appropriate for its title. I'll tell something that this movie will definitely entertain you, no doubt about that but it won't be your favourite product of the year. It is hard to recommend it for one, ***like I said*** if you need entertainment then go for it but don't expect like the first, it was more like a youngster's movie.8/10",True
4135,5 February 2016,jmoneyjohal,"Hail, Caesar! (2016)",8.0,"The Coen brothers don't make bad films,they actually either make classics like Fargo, No Country For Old Men etc or they make near classics like the superbly entertaining film Hail Caesar which I viewed today. I mean these brothers have dabbled in making thrillers, biopics, gory films, comedies, they are masters of all genres. There is a reason why there name is listed with some of the best filmmakers of the world. And with Hail Caesar they strength there status, and make a comedic film on Hollywood and the studio system /rise of communism in Hollywood.While the film was not no extraordinary piece of cinema I would call pathbreaking as maybe you thought was in the offering from the Coen brothers, they actually make there most commercial film till date, and make sure the audience is fully entertained with the extravagant world they create. Hail Cesar is easily the most entertaining film I have seen in this new year of 2016. The film never has a dull moment, here we get see the hilarious insides and outs of Hollywood in the year 1950. The way films are made, how they are casted, all have such a hilarious truthful tone. Even the films main crux a kidnapping is done in a comedic manner. The film has no serious bone, but still Hail Caesar speaks volumes. However what makes Hail Caesar a great film is the casting, and the amazing performances, mainly speaking of Josh Brolin who just lights the screen on fire. Hail Caesar is the most fun I have had in theatres in 2016, however the film has a hangover of Trumbo which released last year, but more on that later.Story wise Slick Hollywood fixer Eddie Mannix is pressed into action when superstar actor Baird Whitlock is kidnapped and held for ransom by a communist group. Mannix races to quietly collect the ransom money without gossip columnist Thora Thacker catching wind of the scandal.Acting wise Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix is the life of the film, he gives one of the best performances of 2016 till now in Hail Ceasar. He shows such variation in his character it's amazing, when he needs to underplay he does it beautiful, at times he is at his comedic best, and at times he is menacing as a Hollywood fixer. The scene when he is slapping George Clooney, and at the end says your a star, that scene was cinema at its best. George Clooney is good as the goof ball actor. Alden Ehrenreich is hilarious as the cowboy actor who can't even say a line proper, at times he steals the show with his comedic act, watch out for his conformation with Ralph Fiennes while shooting a scene in a film. Thora was great in a double role. Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, and Scarlett Johansson all have cameos but they all add great weight age to the film. Hail Caesar has a beautiful ensemble to say the least.Hail Caesar gets the whole aura of 1950s Hollywood down to perfection. The type of actors there where back then ( there attitudes, mannerisms)the type of films that were being made, how the politics behind everything worked, etc was very well researched, and presented lavishly. The production values were superb, the sets, the costumes are first rate. An example of this is the introduction to Scarlett Johansson's characters, that scene is lavishly and beautifully done in the water.The Coen brothers make sure they even get the nitty gritty aspects of the film to perfection. The films main crux however is eerily similar to Trumbo were they speak about communism in Hollywood and the rights of writers etc, however while some novelty is lost here, the mood and the presentation of both films is polls apart. While Trumbo is a political film and speaks in favour of writers, Hail Caesar takes no stance at all, and just waves a comedy around the premise. Honestly the film is more of a day in life of a Hollywood fixer, rather than anything else. Hail Caesar is a hilarious entertaining comedy ***like I mentioned*** earlier,but the best thing is it's a sensible comedy, it's not your regular no brainer, it respects its audiences intelligence,and the film even has a good twist or turn. Two scenes in particular had me laughing my guts out and are the films highlight.The Laurence and Hobie scene when Fiennes is trying to teach the other to act. The other scene is when Brolin slaps,Coolney multiple times, and his reaction is priceless. Hail Caesar is just a entertaining film all around, it might not be a classic you were hoping from the Coens, it might not even win a Oscar( definitely will get a nomination or two), but in hindsight's does it matter, it's a smart comedy, and just think how many films can you say that about. Overall Hail Caesar is a highly recommended watch, it's hilarious and highly entertaining, and the films cast puts on a clinic of acting. The Coens brothers must applauded for making Hail Caesar, because ***like I have stated*** many times it was just such a fun film. Hail Caesar is the best English language film I have seen so far of 2016.4/5* or 8/10",True

(2015) Season 2, Episode 1",9.0,"I often thought the first half of Gotham's opening season was a bit campy and glad the second was glorious and luckily apart from a few bits of campy acting season two opens much better and keeps the last half's more rip roaring style.We open where we left off with Penguin(just a supreme Robin Lord Taylor)being the crime boss king of Gotham(well he thinks),Gordon(Ben McKenzie)reduced to traffic duty,Bullock(Donal Logue)has retired and works in a bar,Barbara(Erin Richards)is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum(along with nutters like Jerome Valeska and Richard Sionis)and Edward Nigma a.k.a Riddler(Cory Michael Smith)has began to truly lose his marbles whilst we find Bruce Wayne(David Mazouz)and Alfred(Sean Pertwee)have discovered a hideout under the fireplace but after climbing down stairs they find a password key pad and can't get past it.After getting kicked off the force by Commissioner Loeb for slightly punishing another cop who arrived late Gordon goes to Penguin for help to get him his job back and getting Loeb fired(in exchange for Gordon collecting a debt for him,which goes wrong of course)leading to Penguin and nasty heavy Victor Zsasz invading Loeb's house,blackmailing him and getting not only Gordon's job back but having Loeb fired and seeing Gordon's friend Sarah Essen(Zabryna Guevara)becoming new commissioner.Whilst this goes on a beautiful lady named Tabitha Galavan(Jessica Lucas)and her guards storm Arkham and kills some Arkham guards and gets Barbara,Jerome,Sionis and three other inmates out and brings them to her brother Theo's place and he tells them all his plans on using them for special jobs to cause mayhem in Gotham but kills Sionis when he tries to leave with Barbara.Bruce and Alfred get into the hideout using a home made bomb where they find a study with computers and a note from Bruce's father telling him of corruption at Wayne Enterprises and to tell Bruce to do the right thing in his life.***Like I said*** a much stronger start than season one and kept the tone of season one's last half and creating more of a continuing story arc compared to standalone episodes which for me makes it stronger and means characters get more of a look in.All the actors are great even if some were a tad camp at times but there is no one I dislike really(not a big fan of Barbara though)and all get to do a lot straight away.My favourite characters are Alfred and Penguin with Gordon,Bullock,Jerome and Edward not far behind all get a great look in with Alfred on typical wisecracking form,Bullock and Harvey having a great buddy cop relationship,Penguin slimy as ever and Edward finally showcasing his future Riddler tendencies plus is Jerome the Joker or not,he certainly has the characteristics of him.This season is all about the bad guys with Penguin,Riddler,Galavan and Jerome the main focus at the moment and all have much screen time here and its great to see future Batman villains showing what could happen even if Barbara is odd as I thought she was Gordon's future wife not some nutter and killing Sionis was strange as I thought he was meant to be Black Mask(another member of Batman's rogue gallery)plus no sign at the moment of the return of Harvey Dent a.k.a. Two Face and Selina Kyle(future Catwoman)only appeared briefly(shame like this version of her)and still the young Ivy is absent(what happened to her Gotham makers).A strong start(with the next two even better)with classic characters moulding into their future selves,usual humour,slimy bad guys,action packed,better story arc and nice shocks even if some characters like Barbara and Galavan are not that interesting and strange choices to either kill big names(Sionis)or not use them much(Selina,Bullock and Zsasz)but its back and getting better every time.",True

It's all very confusing and most of all boring. Okay the producers might not have a big budget but that's not an excuse to make a bad movie. First of all it's way too long and second of all way too boring and repetitive. I won't say that all the positive reviewers are involved in some way with the movie. Some might, but I also think some people have just an awful taste in movies. ***Like one reviewer said***, that he saw thousands of movies, I did also, and to him this one was the best ever, to me it doesn't appear in my top 1000 movies.

4604,6 February 2016,davispittman,The Addams Family (1991),3.0,"The Addams Family (1991) has a well put together stylish look to it, but the script, the dialogue, and the storyline are all void of any substance whatsoever. The cast does a pretty good job and look their roles, but the script they were given to work with just doesn't measure up. Their really isn't much of a storyline, so it might be hard for some to really care that much about this TV show adaptation. The costume design was pretty well put together, and the affection and chemistry between Gomez and Morticia worked well. That was one thing I did enjoy, the on screen chemistry between all the characters really meshed well. But ***like I said***, the plot is just boring and bland and the film gets to where it is hard to pay attention to what's going on because the plot is just so lacking.

4645,6 February 2016,cblazo,Compliance (2012),8.0,"This is a great film. The simplicity and the wonderfully, stupid submission of the main characters is excellent. This film will surely press your buttons and you will be making comments to your television. It is said to be based on true events and with tons of stupid people out there, I believe it. Compliance is a testament to how blindly loyal some folks are to authority. That they will do anything. Including impeding their own morals and values based on a convincing, silver-tongued, smooth talker. You will feel embarrassed and uneasy while watching this movie and for that, the director gets an A+. He portrayed the vision correctly. Which made you feel what the young woman was going through. ***Like I said***. This movie is simple and on a low budget, but the acting is great and complimentary. Ann Dowd played the store manager role superbly. She was believable and came across as a naive, do-gooder with an acceptance issue. Becky was played by Dreama Walker and as an up and coming actress, she did quite well. Compliance is a movie that I watched multiple times and would recommend to most. It's a film that touches on some gray areas and raises the blood pressure due to the total stupidity of some people's belief in all authority.",True

I loved the acting in this movie, ***like I said*** Lily James stole the show, but Sam Riley playing Mr. Darcy also did an amazing job. Definitely a movie worth seeing over and over.

4860,7 February 2016,isak-zettervall,The Revenant (2015),8.0,"--There are no spoilers in this review-- Im writing this review for one specific reason: I want viewers to know what they're getting into. Im gonna start this off by saying if you haven't already watched the trailer, do yourself a favor and don't watch it. I feel like the trailer is kind of misleading. At least it was for me. The trailer made the movie seem like a very action packed movie. If someone explains this movie to you as an epic revenge tale, don't listen to them. Yes, there are some very good (and beautifully shot) fight/action scenes in here, but it's not what drives the movie. This movie is a very realistic survivor story. Probably the best survivor story i've ever seen. It is full of great performances. Leonardo DiCaprio was great in the movie. He doesn't have very much dialogue, his acting is very physical. But that actually just made his performance even more impressive. Will Poulter was also good in the movie, but for me Tom Hardy was the scene stealer. Evey scene Tom Hardy was in was in my opinion great. And I also think he was the best and most interesting character in the movie. This movie is also one of the, if not the best shot movie I have ever seen. You may have heard by now that the director shot this movie in entirely in natural light. And it really payed off. Also the shots in this movie goes on for a long time. There aren't very many cuts which was very cool and impressive to see. ***Like I said***: this is probably the best shot and one of the best looking movies I've ever seen.If you're a lover of cinema you've probably already seen this movie, if not why are you still reading this review? Go see it! And if you're just a casual movie viewer you'll probably also like this movie. You just have to know what you're getting into which is: A very realistic survivor story with great acting and great visuals.Rating: 8/10",True

Yes, movies are subjective and yes, everyone is entitled to their opinion,but with that said, sometimes I think people just like to talk for the sake of talking. This film is nothing more than entertaining at its finest! It is a an excellent parody of horror films that actually has something to say. Don't judge a book by its cover. The acting for a film like this is top notch. Taylor Labine is about to blow up and Alan Tudyk is as solid as they come. The movie moves a long at a fast pace, its funny, gory and unpredictable. So, ***like I said***, I am curious to those that do not like this film, what you consider good.

5561,27 August 2011,rdfarnham,Red Garters (1954),10.0,"Westerns were huge box office at the time this was made as were musicals. Red Garters was designed as a masterful spoof of both genres.

Toss in every cliché from every western movie you have seen (all played straight but tongue in cheek) and a couple of decent, though not highly memorable songs, and you had a fun film. This is not a movie to be taken seriously and it spoofs itself as much as anything. The real star is, of course, Rosie Clooney who was in full voice and at the peak of her career. A great movie?

The characters became dull and the acting also lost something. Some episodes didn't even focus on what I THOUGHT was the main focus; tennis. I know, I know, just because tennis is an important part of the show doesn't mean it has to be in every episode, but still. I started to feel like they were straying away from everything in order to create new plot lines that would usually only last three seconds. ***Like I said*** before; the story just got dull. It was just the same people with the same problems. There was little character development (since the plane crash) and eventually Laurence Laboeuf's acting started getting on my nerves (her narratives were quite dry).If you really need something to watch and there is nothing on TV aside from 15 Love, watch it.

6188,5 July 2020,dwpollar,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015),8.0,"1st watched 7/14/2020 - (Dir-J.J. Abrams):
Excellent start to a new trilogy in the Star Wars franchise. This movie has the same energy and appeal as the original with a very similar storyline, but I didn't really care that this was the case. It starts with the patented pre-story scroll that we have expected from the series, and we learn that Luke Skywalker is missing at the point where he was supposed to be training a new group of rebels, and the ""First Order"" is now the new Empire with the rebellion just hanging on by a thread....sound familiar? The character ""Rey"" is a lonely parent-less new Skywalker-type and is already filled with the force, but is a slave without a hope or purpose for herself. The rebellion determines that a droid has a map to find the actual Skywalker, but lose it and it gets dropped off on Rey's planet and she acquires it. At the same time - the First Order lead by a Darth-Vader type character(who happens to be the child of Han and Leia) also is aware of this, and the chase after her and the droid begins. I guess they both believe that finding Skywalker will have a major impact on the campaigns because he will decide to continue what he stopped doing when found ? (this could be a stretch) Finn is a character who is similar to Hans in the original movie, but is a defector from the dark side's army(actual he is a sanitation person but still a part of them), and wants to help the rebellion now. They pick up the Millinieum Falcon in a junk yard while escaping and they get pulled into what they think is owned by the dark side, but ends up being a smuggling post lead by the actual Han Solo. He and chewie than get connected to their old ship, but Rey gets picked up by the evil side setting up the ""rescue of the maiden premise."" Amazingly later we find out that the new ""Death Star"" has a spot the rebellions can shoot at and blow up it up....doesn't this sound familiar? The new General Leia directs the troops to do this and we than have a reunion of Han and Leia. So - ***like I said*** - a lot like the original, but the tempo and characters are likeable enough to keep you interested most of the way thru. I'm a little amazed I rated this so high, but the movie just pops not unlike the 1st Star Wars movie and finished with a bang and a couple of un-finished threads. Lucasfilm and Abrams knew what worked and they delivered on this continuation of the world of Star Wars.",True

Other than that, it is completely implausible, ridiculous, uninteresting, and unimportant. What is the moral of the story, if you can call it a story? Lesbians are only lesbians when their men are away. What the . . . I wonder how many lesbians would agree with that. Any other guy in his right mind would divorce this sick woman in no time flat when she started acting like an insensitive freak; sorry to say most guys would probably just slap the heck out of her and be done with it, jail or no jail, and that probably would have prevented a suicide at least.

It doesn't matter that she's having an affair with a woman, she just as well could be having an affair with a guy, what difference does it make. Hey guys, do you want your wife cheating on you on your honeymoon? ICK. I know some people get into that whole swinger thing, but that's just it, it's a choice. Doesn't seem like hubby has much of a choice here. He really doesn't want to get involved with the creepy Russian dingbat who is seducing his wife, but he plays along with it helplessly in order to try to save his marriage, then the freak offs herself, and he runs away with the Russian chick?

Night Shyamalan is not a director I've been very familiar with over the years, having only seen his much-lauded and much-overrated The Sixth Sense, but he seems absurdly pretentious and smug. And all I have to say to that is, if this fecal matter is the best he can do these days, then he had better start learning some god damned humility.The Happening is another one of those fashionable natural disaster movie, only about ten times worse than you'd usually expect. This movie boasts deplorable writing, awful acting, plastic characters that try and fail to get you to care about them, and THE LAMEST DISEASE EVER. I won't spoil it for those of you who have not seen it yet, but this disease and the ""plot"" constructed around it are absolutely laughable. It seems to be TRYING to build up, but it doesn't work, and mostly this just comes off as a bunch of suspenseful (haha) scenes strung together on a clothesline with no punch line or climax or anything of the sort. Oh, and why do all the characters in this movie have to say ""happening"" so much? Annoying as Hell. This is basically a shitty 80s B movie with a modern sheen, and that is more horrifying than anything Shyamalan could conjure up in his writing.Oh, and have I mentioned how delightfully retarded this is? I mean, we have people talking to plants, the main character and his fiancée arguing about their petty problems in the middle of a train station where everyone is trying to escape the virus, and worst of all, the frighteningly dumb jab at the Americans with all of the references to ""terrorists."" Nice one, Shyamalan. All Americans are like that, indeed. F*ck you all the way to the bank.So basically, all the viewer can really do, deprived of any visible plot or hook to grab onto, is sit in awe of the puerile dialogue and attempts at characterization, which are so bad they're funny, and I actually found myself laughing at this more than real comedies ***like Death to Smoochy and Tropic Thunder, which leaves something to be said*** for those, as well. I'll chuck a few points onto the rating here, as it did make me laugh a few times, but really, The Happening is an awful movie and I would not recommend it.",True

Even so, the movie is absolutely horrible. Moments that looked rather ***like the director didn't even take the movie seriously himself- when Bella first sits next to Edward is one- and bad acting cannot make up for a bland, and as others have said***, predictable story. If one were to have just seen the movie,I'm sure there were many plot holes as well, like WHY the black vampire was traveling with two such dangerous vampires in the first place, and if he did know why did he not join them. This movie isn't worth the money I spent, much less going to the midnight showing- though I must admit when the movie started going backwards and upside down, it was pretty good. What? That wasn't part of the movie? Just a technical error? Dang, then this movie has no entertainment value. Also, to the girl two rows down from me in the theater, this movie, nor its book counterweight, are not even close to being compared to The Lord of The Rings.",True
7267,5 December 2008,localsixeight,Smart People (2008),1.0,"Lisa Simpson is smart and often right about things. When she gets one-uped in the intelligence arena she usually sees is as an opportunity to learn and make new friends (of which she has few) like when she met the new girl at school who was younger, smarter and could also plays the sax- better. Or when she met Paul McCartney. But ***like I said***, she's lonely, marooned by keen mind and opinions she can't restrain herself from having and vocalizing. Being smart isn't all it's cracked up to be.Maybe that's the message the movie makers were going for in Smart People. Sure these people are smart- that's a given! (Is it?) But are they happy? No. They're miserable. They're flamboyant jerks. They're book smart, sure, maybe. But emotionally? No. Functionally? Not at all. The college professor can't even operate a condom. Gets a girl pregnant who he has only dated for a short time, each date ending in argument and hurt feelings and one or the other of the two calling the other ""an asshole"". So Smart People, shouldn't't you keep the baby, get married and magically all will be well? You worry about what kind of life the kid will have.This movie is bleak, depressing. The actors in it are all fine actors. Generally they all are in better movies. Like the Smart People in the movie they made poor decisions. Though they acted well in the movie, the movie was uneven, strangely unresolved, not a smart choice for my rental that night. There was one fun part, where in two of the characters get high and watch Mexican soap operas, laughing and interpreting zanily. But that can't carry the movie. If you want feel good-don't rent this. If you want clever- this has that, but it goes absolutely no where, and clever dialogue aside, much of what goes on is brainlessness, short term decision making, and audience frustration.",True

But sometimes it really pays off.First off, let me start by saying that in my opinion, this was one CRAZY movie. But I guess thats why I like it so much. Not a whole lot seemed to make perfect sense, but I guess thats what they were aiming for.The best performance by far was Jean Reno as Leon, the lonely professional hit-man, living in a run-down apartment down the hall from a dysfunctional family. Cast out in the family is Mathilda (Played by a young Natalie Portman), the 12 year old daughter who seems to be kicked around by everyone in the family except her little brother. While out shopping, Mathilda's family is killed by corrupt DEA agents, led by the completely insane Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman).Among many good performances was a unique plot, and many memorable scenes and lines. The music score really helps set the mood of each and every scene. ***Like I mentioned***, I think this is a crazy movie so maybe thats why it stands out.

I am a fan of Woody Allen's early work (***like ""Manhattan"" etc) and was delighted to read that with this movie, he was said*** to be back to his ""old style"". What? OK. Let's be fair. It was esthetically filmed and not a complete nuisance to watch, with good actors. But that's all. That's why I give 3 out of 10. Basically, the story is very dull. It's a mediocre piece of work (ok, Allen is no genius, but at least he used to be pretty entertaining). It made me think ""is this showing the aging Woody Allen's erotic fantasies?"". What is the message? There is no plot that is worth the mention. And character development? No. The passion(s) that develop are not even that: developed! They are not credible. I felt that the audience is made believe that the shown emotions exist this way - but it's that: make-believe. I did not believe much of what I saw, and, perhaps more sadly, I could not care less for it anyway. A ""wanna-be-exotic-and-interesting"" movie. Dull dull dull.",True
8093,4 May 2020,hnt_dnl,"Westworld: Crisis Theory (2020) Season 3, Episode 8",1.0,"Now that Season 3 is officially (and thankfully) one for the books, I can freely say that the finale lived down to the second half awfulness of the season. I feared that I lamented the poor second act one episode too early in the review for the prior episode, but this terrible finale titled CRISIS THEORY just strengthened my resolve that Season 3 as a whole is just not good. In fact, I might say it's even worse than Season 2 mainly because the writers hung their hats on the worst aspect of the series: the action scenes. This finale was virtually all action, all the time.There was so much illogic in this season that it is mind-boggling, but the finale takes the cake. Why is every single person in the entire world, which seems to consist of only about a thousand people, ready to riot over things that haven't even happened yet? Why didn't Dolores finish off Maeve when she had the chance given that Maeve has tried to kill her multiple times already? Why is Hale so hellbent on destroying Dolores when it was Serac that had her family killed? Why didn't Serac just kill Caleb himself? He had no qualms murdering that identity broker earlier in the season. Why didn't he have his guards kill Maeve immediately when he froze her? Why didn't Maeve just use her hacking powers much earlier in the season to disable Serac's host-controlling device? Why has Bernard been having such a hard time finding Dolores the entire season if he was always connected to her and could somehow ""sense"" what was happening with her?But my biggest gripe with this episode, well other than the dumb action scenes, is basically the main plot point of the season that introduces a whole slew of holes: so Dolores actually remembered Caleb from the finally revealed Park 5, which was a training ground for soldiers. OK. First, wasn't Dolores basically in the Westworld Park for her entire existence since she was it's main attraction and the park's oldest host? When did Ford find time to move her to another park? Where were THESE memories at all the time Dolores was complaining about the evil human race? Second, how did Caleb not even remember Dolores, especially with all of his memories coming back to him over the course of the season? Finally, how could Dolores possibly know that she would run into Caleb way back in the season premiere? Everything that happened to get them together relied on way too many coincidences.And the action scenes are just abominable. The Dolores-Maeve fight was pathetic. Serac's guards and security have no kind of tactical fighting techniques. They repeatedly give away their positions by breaking silence protocols. They just stand there and do nothing when Serac tells them to kill whoever. And that post-credit scene with William...are you kidding me? There was actually that beautifully acted scene between Bernard and Arnold's wife, but that was about it. This episode was just so bad overall I can't give it more than 1 star even with that little gem.It's ***like the writers knew they needed a big finale ending and just said*** ""we need the bad guy to lose."" The finale was like some cheesy 80s action flick except those movies never pretended to be great.

9097,24 February 2020,Horst_In_Translation,Am Anfang war die Eifersucht (2001 TV Movie),2.0,"""Am Anfang war die Eifersucht"", which means ""At the beginning there was jealousy"", is a German television movie from 2001, so this one is already almost 20 years old. Well, if we take a look at the year of production shown during the closing credits, it actually has its 20th anniversary this year. It runs for 90 minutes, slightly under like most German small screen releases, and it is a sequel to a movie that has almost the same name and was released back in 1999. Only the ord at the end is different. What is not different, however, is that these two films are basically the same level quality-wise and this level is one that you really really want to stay away from. Admittedly, and this is the only positive thing I can say about this film here is that it is sometimes not as horrible as the original, but still there was never any other plan in my mind while watching this film that I could give it more than one star out of five, which is my lowest rating and means failure territory. It's no surprise it turned out this bad with basically not only the entire cast returning, but also the crew being the same. Director is once again Hartmut Griesmayr and the script is by spouses Amelie Fried and Peter Probst. The first film was based on Fried's novel. This one here is not. It just continues the story for the characters and as far as I know there is also no book that this sequel is based on. So the readers are more lucky than the viewers here that this unbearable mess does not existed in print. I have not read the original book, but ***like I said*** the writer is the same as the one in charge of the screenplay, so I am entirely convinced the book is bad too. By the way, I just watched the first film not too long ago for the first time. I usually say that it is pretty shocking if there is more than one writer in charge of the screennplay and the outcome is really so horrible, but here I am not surprised. I am really sure that both Fried and Probst lack the talent for a quality script completely. Still pretty horrible how a man can at least be partially in charge for a film that is so strictly against males in its desperate attempts to get femmales to watch the movie. Disgusting. Women's rights activists would be up in arms if the gender roles were the other way around. It really is an abomination. Be it the happily cheating husband in the first film or the guy who is interested in the female protagonist in this one, it is just embarrassing. By the way, you can also include Korff's character here. He plays a really likable character, but of course he also gets the possibility that he could just be a fraud who is after Queen Mom's (ugh!) money, even if the truth is different in the end with this pseudo dramatic cancer story. And by the way with one character saying that it was all a lie and he cannot give them the money, that makes no sense either because the money would be from the bank and not from him directly. Ridiculous stuff. By the way when the female protagonist's character does not mention she is secretly preparing for an exam to make money for the family, it is alright because it is such a kind-hearted idea, but when Korff's character dooes not say it, then he is stupid and a liar because everybody would have understood. Oh yeah, the husband here also gets his fair share again of course with how he spends all day on a park bench after secretly quitting his job or how he is super jealous when he suspects his wife is having an affair. So the negative references in this film as well as the first are about him both times. Of course both negative aspects about him, while his wife is a true saint. And obviously they did not forget to remember us of his affair from the first film.Now I mentioned the female protagonist already a couple times and with this I mean Simone Thomalla. If you hear this name, then you will know immediately that this film is one to stay away from. She has been a lead in so so many German films over the year and God knows why. Or Satan more likely. She has not a single ounce of talent in her body when it comes to acting, showing range and versatility. All her popularity is about her looks, which are also really overrated in my opinion. So in short you can say that she is just as untalented as her influencer daughter, but strangely enough she managed a long career. I mean the moment when the film hits rock-bottom comes early on already when we see her fake an orgasm after her man does not ant to have sex with her and honestly this scene alone if a prime example of how this woman does not care one bit for females and being an inspiration or even role model to them. It was incredibly messy. And she has more scenes like that. It sure requires a really special (absence of) skill to make this horrible screenplay look even worse, but she manages masterfully and effortlessly to do so. There are so many examples I could state. Be it the speech at the wedding near the end, all the scenes with her new suitor or everythink linked to the house possibly being sold or her role as a mother (and daughter). By the way, speaking of her suitor, he is of course scum too as he indirectly tries to blackmail our lovable heroine into sleeping with him if she wants the job. And of course he realizes immediately that he made a huge mistake because she is so perfect and talented. Really ironic to see this ""actress"" portray somebody allegedly talented. I guess people who believe one bit of this movie are completely hopeless and there must be quite a few if this film received high enough ratings for a sequel. Oh and I also would like to mention those scene involving the male child actor. Of course, he was pretty bad too here, but the script definitely did not do him any favors. I laughed so hard at the scene when he poses as a blind man. I am sure the filmmakers meant this seriously, but this was so bad it was funny. Sadly, this was the only moment with such absurdity that made me at least chuckle a bit. The rest was just plain bad. This includes the entire story about the boy and his eyesight. I mean what parents do not realize how their child sees nothing basically. Awesome parents. Oh well, I guess they are forgiven eventually because we find out the boy faked it all along, so they do not move to another home. Oh that makes sense, very good connection there. Then again, obviously Thomalla's character is also a great mother, so she would have recognized it in fact before it had even happened with the boy's eyesight. The scene at the oculist (terrible actor too and so poorly wwritten) is just as cringeworthy as the moment when the boy quotes his grandma later on. But what was even more rock-bottom was when he says he would get lost in the new apartment right at the very start. Honestly, I was already willing to turn this off when I heard the characters singing. At least they did not continue with Thomalla's character's story from the first movie that she is a talented singer, which her voice is nothing special at all. So overall, everybody who worked on this project should really be ashamed. This is such a mess and honestly I am glad to see they did not make a third movie another two years later. Looking at writer Fried's other works as well, which basically all sucked, yet got adapted into movies, you know this one here is a project that you would not ant to atch a single minute from. Second, actually, also because you can see it takes itself completely seriously, has this stupid unrealistic happy ending and the over-the-top soundtrack. Highly not recommended. You can hear your brain cells commit suicide while it's on.",True

This episode was well directed and had some good cinematography, overall great! I loved the natural lightning, really gave it atmosphere and immersed me into the claustrophobia of the cave. It's still pretty damn bad that they got in that situation with being stuck in a cave by the hands of Alpha but now when we get to see it play out and see the sets they built? I found it entertaining and great, long time since we got a true walker based episode.The story arcs we get to follow is of course the main group trying to escape the trap set by Alpha and the other plot is The Whisperers and Negan. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is as always so damn good as Negan, but he isn't the best one in this episode. Best acting of the episode is in my opinion Norman Reedus and Melissa McBride they did some amazing work in these 40 minutes, capturing emotion and brought their finest. With that said, this season have built a lot on who Carol is as a person after the death of her adopted son and I've enjoyed the story arc as I feel her more human than the bad ass killing machine she was before, I can't wait to see what they bring to her character and some others.The episode could easily have been an okey to bad one, if not for the acting and amazing cast of actors and characters. It's a really slow burner, not much happens in the 44 minutes. That's a negative thing but they make it so intense and suspenseful which has us on the edge of our seats. ***Like I said***, it could have easily been a bad episode but the writers and director managed to create a great episode!",True
9165,24 February 2020,tcamyuntoldartist,Sonic the Hedgehog (2020),10.0,"For some reason payed critics feel like judging this movie by standards of all time top 100 pieces of mastery featuring deep philosophical messages and drama. But it is not the flippin' Godfather for crying out loud.For what it is, for what it should be, it is pure brilliance, only slightly hindered by sparse spikes of capitalism (product placement that at certain points actually seemed ***like parodies of product placements as they were so direct and said*** out loud), a very strange cut at around 3/4 of the movie featuring Donut Lord and Pretzel Lady (you WILL know what i'm talking about when you see it), an entire ONE cgi side shot of a one wheeler robot that is actually rather nasty (it is like a good second long), and original (pop-ish...) music that is not that memorable even if strangely fitting most of the time.I feel the movie is paced excellently. Starts out as cute, and fun, then quite emotional, and just then, when you already feel this is great so far, enters Robotnik into the picture... and elevates things up to 11. Sonic can feel a tad bit too coked up sometimes, but when you start feeling he's a bit much, something happens that slaps him to turn more serious or downright knocks him out for a few minutes. Or we are suddenly given a very cool, once even quite lengthy slowdown scene that play purely on the visuals and not the talking. The way Robotnik utilizes Sonic's power for himself at one point was just a fantastic idea. From the trailers by the way you'd think this is going to be an other freakin comedic road movie, with plenty of clichéd hijinks happening along the way, but the move from Green Hills to San Francisco was unexpectedly sudden, and short lived their stay was as their return right back to Green Hills was quite an expedient one practically by free fall.This is the kind of movie that is OBVIOUSLY for kids, but not in the usual condescending way, that immediately locks out adults, or should i say... 'big kids'. Seriously if you look at something like this, and dismiss it saying ""you are beyond things like this"", you lack the kid in you that should never truly die.If you ever liked playing a Sonic game, preferably one from the golden era of Sega (1991-2001), you WILL like it, and many of you WILL love it as well.I only hope now for a more classic story for the at least as halfway decent as this was sequel, about the Eggman Empire in Sonic's land, and as a Sega diehard i can die happily.

9763,25 February 2020,geoff-spurr,"Endeavour: Zenana (2020) Season 7, Episode 3",8.0,"Endeavour has been my favourite series ever on TV but standards dropped in series 7. ***In response to another review***, in a show of mutual respect Endeavour will finish with 3 episodes in series 8, giving 33 episodes in total, exactly the same as Inspector Morse and Lewis.
The original series were self contained episodes but Endeavour has become a serial, which worked well building tension to the series 6 finale, but series 7 has felt like 3 episodes of one story which seemed to lessen the overall enjoyment. Ludo and his wife didn't work well as characters (especially in Oxford), the different attackers on the towpath was not convincing, (wasn't it a woman who attacked the flasher?). The breakdown in the relationship between Fred and Morse was not pleasant for fans to see.
Russell Lewis has taken liberties with the original Morse character, who famously moaned about his lack of romance in his younger days, the will they/won't they storyline with Joan worked well but he's also lived a nurse and had flings with Fred's niece, the French photographer and Ludo's wife.
Series 8 is going to be tricky, it's hard to see how the much loved characters of Fred, Strange, Bright and Max can be a part of it when Morse moves to McNutt so having many new characters will be something of a gamble.

10191,1 September 2020,Horst_In_Translation,Uferlos! (2013 TV Movie),2.0,"""Uferlos!"" is a German television film from 2013, so this one has its seventh anniversary this year. It runs for slightly under 1.5 hours as they usually do and the title means something like ""Shoreless!"" I suppose. On the one hand, it is supposed to describe the lake situation where the film is set and the fight about who is allowed to have access to it (even if this explanation is a bit shoddy too, it's just about the water I suppose), while on the other hand it is about the female protagonist's isolation. The ! surprises me a bit I must say. Very unusual for films by ARd or ZDF, but here they took this route probably because one word did not seem enough for them. One-word titles are a rarity as well when it comes to those two television stations. The director is Rainer Kaufmann, very experienc ed and prolific, also some alright movies in his body of work, not as bad as the people they usually hire for this kind of movies. That would be more the likes of writer Silke Zertz, whose body of work may not be downright horrible, but still very weak overall. The outcome is not expected as a consequence. As for the cast, the title describes the main character played by Hannelore Hoger. She is an experienced actress for sure and honestly I felt that she did not do the worst job here, managed to elevate the material here and there and even if the film (because of the botched screenplay) is already pretty bad, it perhaps would have been worse without her and another female lead like Jutta Speidel or so. She often gets cast for this kind of films. But Hoger managed to be quietly convincing here and there I felt. Oh well, maybe I am being too kind here and she is just not as bad as the other production values. Nonetheless it needs to be said that the cast here is certainly not a problem or at least not the biggest problem. The male lead is Rolf Lassgård and this film is actually from fairly briefly before he played the lead in a Swedish movie that managed big waves internationally, no less than two Oscar nominations, so here you can see an ounce of his talent already. Maybe he is the main reason why prople are still watching this one. Or maybe not because it is a film in the German language, not in Swedish, so Swedes will have little chance and maybe little interest to check this one out. The rest of the cast includes a handful of experienced German actors. Film buffs from my country will recogize some of these like Brendler, who has nothing to do here except acting pregnant, and Schubert, who has slightly more to do as he is kind of the main antagonist to Hoger's character here, but a friendly antagonist nonetheless. There are no bad people in here, no real villains. However, no matter what all these actors tried, this film was doomed to fail from the start of production because the screenplay is what makes a movie and same is true here, but in a pretty negative sense.I must say sometimes I even thought the story was tolerable and Hoger was good enough for this to be a weak film at least, not a terrible film, but in the end, it becomes painfully obvious again that calling it weak is certainly going too easy on the outcome here. There are many moments. Be it the inevitable love story between the two protagonists (a bit surprising given the age difference that is visible honestly), be it the mailwoman's role and how she randomly ends up in bed with the male protagonist towards the end, be it the rushed-in solution that Hoger's parents got the area from jews during the days of the Nazi regime etc. It all feels fake and for the sake of it, rushed-in for pseudo drama purpose because this film took itself seriously very much. This one is not on too often anymore because it is a ZDF production and they do not have a dozen smaller stations like ARD (Degeto) to show reruns constantly, but actually this is a good thing here because it definitely has no real right to still be on national television almost a decade after it aired originally. The Johnny Cash song early on was okay though, a bit random nonetheless. What was very random is that the two new neighbors end up in a boat together minutes after meeting for the first time and he jumps into the water. Was this supposed to show us that they can be their true selves in each other's company? I don't know, it felt a little bizarre though. There are also animals in here, the female protagonist loves birds, but yeah when the man's cat keeps hunting those down, of course Hoger's character is not happy. Admittedly, the number of ""victims"" felt exaggerated. They can fly away, you know. Or what Hoger's character did as a consequence with the cat. Were they for real? I think so. Anyway, there are more moments like those. It all feels fake and unauthentic and with imdb calling this a comedy, I must say I never laughed. The solution back to happiness towards the end also felt fake. Sure she finds that message now who originally lived in that house. Still I must say that Hoger's character's tears after that scene and how she depicts her isolation and how she cannot stand people felt authentic on several occasions. ***Like I said***, she is alright. But then there's moments like the daughter of course being married to the guy who wants to take the premises from ther daughter's mother and the daughter being about to give birth in the midst of this massive turmoil etc. I also felt that the environmental message in here was in theory promising early on, but what they turned it into eventually wwas just a big embarrassing mess. The subject deserves way better, but this is what happens when an untalented writer butchers a story like this. Dreadful. Of course, eventually all goes well with the birth and they cannot take her to the hospital, but she must give birth right there with her mother being her midwife. Okay. And no comment on the guys they hired too play the demonstrators with their signs. Oh boy, this was cringeworthy to say the least. Overall, a pretty bad film, one you need to skip at any cost. Luckily, the number of votes here on imdb shows that most people did. Yes, I may sound a bit harsh here, but trust me: The film is indeed as terrible as it sounds. Low production values all along. As a consequence, the humor is never funny and the conflict feel all fake. Highly not recommended.",True
10462,1 September 2020,SAMTHEBESTEST,Tenet (2020),8.0,"Tenet (2020) :
Movie Review -I can say it loud and clear that, we haven't seen something groundbreaking like this before and we may never see something like this. The reason for it is, Tenet is based on a time breaking concept which crosses all the barriers of physics, time flow, inversion, reversion, past, present and future tense. We haven't been introduced to Time-squeezing maneuvers before and in Tenet we get to see multiple dimensions running simultaneously which makes it a crazy visual experience. I mean at one moment it feels like how did they shoot this scene? How did they edited it? How did they even think of writing such a scene? It all goes beyond imagination in this unseen world of Tenet and one must prepare his the brain before watching it because this is going to shake your mind with complexions.The story of Tenet is pretty much predictable and believe me this is an insult of Nolan but the master had some different plans as he tells this predictable story in unpredictable way. A mission of saving the World from extinction is anything but not simple. Tenet is intricate but how much? If i could count it in numbers then it is 11 out 10 i mean one step higher than where your rating ends. When it comes to understanding the film there are different possibilities for sure, like, in first watch you might understand it completely, or you might not understand it and dislike it but then you might understand it in 2nd viewing and find it mind-boggling stuff or something because it is complex indeed. Not just any regular complex show but something really confusing. For instance, i can say that, Inception was lot easier to understand than Tenet and i mean it. I hope you know what i mean, any smart movie buff will surely get it.Tenet has really got lot of good performances from talented cast members. I can't name all but surely the main leading cast is amazing which includes John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh and other supporting actors. The writing, ***like I said*** before crosses all the limits of complexity and it took me a little while to realise what just happened, what did they just said and what was it all about. High chances that Tenet needs to be watched twice to understand all the detailings otherwise you just don't get it properly. Thank god it doesn't leave you with any questions at the end as there is a one solid end to all the theories.Technical aspects of Tenet are truly amazing. The background score will win you over in the opening scene itself and then there are lot of it keep coming up. Cinematography is on some next level as we just can't imagine half the people running backwards and rest half running opposite at the same time. The same goes to the visual team as they achieve artistically groundbreaking visuals which were never seen before and might never be seen in future. Dialogues are too dedal and with the help of Subtitles you can keep them in memory. Director Christopher Nolan has left me speechless yet again. I am not sure about numbers that how many times I've said the same thing. If there was anyone who could have thought of handling hell of a complex film like Tenet then it was only Nolan and nobody else and he didn't disappoint. I am shocked and stunned by his thinking and vision that how every time he comes up with something mind blowing and yet makes it feel mind blowing every time? I mean we never feel fed up by his news ideas and we never even get bored of watching the same film Multiple times. Without a shadow of doubt, Nolan is the best director in the world (of his time) and i am proud to be his Fan.Tenet offers something out of the borders even if you think that you are ready for unlimited features and mind-shaking cinematic graphics. The only problem with Tenet is, it feels soulless after all. The emotional angle doesn't work at any level hence the feelings for the characters never pick. Otherwise, it is a complete package of mind shattering concept, groundbreaking visuals, technical brilliance, atmospheric tension and Nolan's timebreaking vision which makes it a wonderful Cinematic Experience. Highly recommended ""But only for intelligent cine viewers.""RATING - 8/10*",True
10466,1 September 2020,samhendersonthemovieman,A Quiet Place (2018),9.0,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a fan of scary movies or horror movies, although I'm only interested in pretty much anything by M. Night Shyamalan and Jaws. I originally wasn't planning on watching it or seeing it, but my family wanted to watch it and I heard from most of my friends saying that it's not too scary, but suspenseful, so I was reluctant and decided to watch it. I was very surprised that the movie is slightly silent and uses sign language throughout, even though it did have some dialogue in a couple scenes. Anyways, the originality of the movie is very innovative and genius. The acting throughout the movie was very well-acted, especially from Emily Blunt, even though there wasn't a lot of dialogue. There are a lot of scenes where they build up big tension and leave you breathless and shaking. The sound mixing and design of the creatures also is very creative and creepy to hear. The directing from John Krasinski, who also starred in the movie, is very interesting that he starred in the movie as the same time and made me wonder ""How does he do that at the same time?"" It's also very interesting that Emily Blunt and John Krasinski were a couple in reality and they were a couple in the movie as well. Also, the ending leaves you very amazed and breathless, making you wondering what would happen next in a sequel in the future. You wouldn't believe your eyes or ears when you witness the movie. The story also was very inventive, which was the combination of silent movie and thriller at the same time. The music is really eerie and astounding at the same time, which was what you'll hear most of the movie because it had sign language at the same time ***like I said***. A Quiet Place is a very intense thriller that leaves you at the edge of your seat, one of the most worth watching for non scary movie fans like me, and surprising movies I've ever seen. 9.5/10",True

10693,1 September 2020,Horst_In_Translation,Wink des Himmels (2005 TV Movie),2.0,"""Wink des Himmels"" is a German television film from 2005, so this one has its 15th anniversary this year, which is normally an occasion to celebrate, but with how low the quality here is, it is more on the opposite end of the scale and pretty embarrassing that this film is still shown on national television, even if it is only a smaller channel and not exactly prime time. Nonetheless, the fewer people watch this, the better. The director is Karola Hattop and as she already worked on movies back in the 1970s, she was already a highly prolific filmmaker by 2005. But also this means that in my opinion she is a definite contender for worst German filmmaker from the last 50 years because her body of work is all about quantity and not one bit about quality. Truly pathetic. The writer is Natalie Scharf. She has not been active for that long, but also since the late 1990s, and her body of work is nothing to be proud of either. Still, the pretty good ""Dschungelkind"", maybe her defining career movie, is better than everything Hattop has been a part of. These 1.5 hours, slightly under as usual, we have here, however, do not bring quality to anybody's body of work here. That includes all the people who were part of this project, not only the aforementioned behind the camera, but also thoe in front of it. The ones audiences usually recognize. Well, this is only partially true because the cast is not spectacular at all, even for a small screen release from my country here and these are never star-studded. Anyway, the only supporting cast member I am familiar with here is Bürger and maybe Wussow too, but only because of his name and father. The two leads are by far more known, but not necesarily for good reasons. Both are fairly limited actors I'm sure. Admittedly, it must be said that Helmut Zierl is by no means as bad as hhis female counterpart Elisabeth Lanz. Both have been in many bad films, however. There is no denying there at all. I have seen some of their stuff and it is pretty abysmal here almost all the time. Maybe Lanz' inclusion int he cast for a lead character is also one reason why this movie here is an Austrian co-production, but also the bigger reason obviouly is ORF being a part of it.Now in the second paragraph, let me talk a bit about specific scenes and moments from this film that made it extremely obvious how this is a film that is still bad in its better moments. It already starts fairly weak as we see the male protagonist sitting there in the nature all on his own like a desirable lone cowboy. But things do get way worse. The best (or worst) example of that is for example the dove scene early on when the boy wants a mother again and a woman for his father at the same time lets the dove fly away and she flies to Lanz' character at a construction site and while the two men there are annoyed by it, want it to leave, even try to catch it, the woman is somewhat amused and even sees the romantic component immediately and tries all she can to find the owner of the dove or pigeon. Never really know what the difference is. Not important anyway. What matters more is that really everything involving the dove was utterly ridiculous in a bad way. There is one more, namely when the female protagonist talks to the male protagonist on one occasion about how the pigeon was lost, wanted to land, but did not know where and clearly this was meant in a (not exactly) subtle manner in a metaphoric way as if she was talking about herself. In order for us to understand how desirable the two lovebirds (no pun intended!) are, we also find out that the man has a suitor himself and the woman is in a relationship, close to marriage in fact. But her man does not treat her like a goddess the way she (and every other woman) deserves, so it is absolutely nothing bad that she cheats on him with the male character. Imagines how condescending the film would be if her fiancé cheated on her during his business trip. He'd be personified evil honestly. Only women get away with stuff like that in these sexist ARD afternoon movies. This one here is no exception. But hey, he puts career over her, does not wwant a kid, fly away instead of staying with his love, so he deserves it coming his way that she is falling for somebody else. There are many other scenes and aspects wrong with this movie, but I just wanna forget about them as soon as possible. Okay, one more: the entire conflict story in the second half when the man's employee lies about his love becausse she still wwants him to become an item with her daughter. This is so messed-up. Pseudo drama of the worst kind. Also how he slaps her. Okay, that was so bad that it was almost funny honestly. But there are no evil characters in here, no antagonists really and even the elderly lady realizes what a mistake she made and of course the happy ending is inevitable eventually and the two protagonists are together, not much longer after the female's original lover begs his woman to stay with him, even if she cheated on him. Charming. She gets away with everything. But hey, it is true love. Just like it was with the male protagonist's deceased former wife. Yep, more sob story here. I feel kinda bad for everybody who falls for this scam of a movie. Honestly, the ending, when they are united, with the help of the dove is also as cheesy and schmaltzy as it gets. ***Like I wrote*** in the title of my review. But then again, this description fits the entire film really. So many other scenes and moments I could mention. Okay one more to sum it all up: the boy's phone calls early on when his dad is on a date with a woman he does not like. And another: the boy running away. Kids running away always happens for ""dramatic"" reasons in these films. Or Zierl's character being on a date again with the other woman from early on when the ""love of his life"" seems one. or when he mistakes another couple about to get married for the woman of his dreams and her man. And so on and so forth. There is much more. In short, this is a terrible movie. One where you should not be hesittant for a minute to realize they are trying to evoke the biggest of emotions while offering the smalles of talent. Not gonna work like that. A dafinite contender for worst German film of 2005. As shallow as it gets and the very worst about it is actually that they were utterly serious with it. Unreal. Fat thumbs-down.",True

11019,26 August 2013,jgeils223,The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones (2013),9.0,"No spoilers, just general feedback....I am writing as a 36 year old mother of 2 and wife... I read all the books and had a hard time putting them down. I was so excited when I heard they were making this movie, but usually the books are better. I was praying that this production crew would do the books justice, like the ones on Twilight... So I dragged my husband on our anniversary! The movie was great... Action packed, the filming was done great and the love story was not cheesy (***Like my husband said*** of Twilight...actually ""corny"" was the right word). Anyways, I personally thought that they stuck to the story line the BEST they could for a 2 hour & 10 min movie. If they touched base on everything, it would be a 4 hour movie. With that said, the movie is worth seeing, even if you haven't read the books... you will NOT be lost. My husband only had 1 question through out the movie and the rest he was able to follow. Jamie Campbell-Bower did AMAZING as Jace. So I hope all those people who criticized him, feel stupid. He brought Jace to life the entire movie and even was able to show the very rare softer side of him as well. A total knock out in my opinion!!",True
11125,26 August 2013,cartman_1337,John Carter (2012),1.0,"""Star Wars for a new generation""; that's what the Blu-ray cover would have us believe. If this is indicative of what Disney have in store for us with Star Wars Episode VII, then there is all reason to worry. And considering this was made by the same company, even with the same cinematographer confirmed for SWVII, there's good reason to think it is.Borrowing heavily from sci-fi movies ***like Star Wars, Star Trek and Avatar, and even from Disney's own animated sci-fi serial; Lilo and Stitch (the martian tribes looks exactly like, except for the color of the skin, the female boss in the alien affairs bureau, or whatever it was called, in said*** movie), and very little from the books it's actually based, this movie moves on as one of the least original movies I've ever seen. Instead it's one cliché after another, one massive rip-off after another, and what's worse, one piece of cheesy dialog after another. I thought fighting for Unobtanium, or whatever it was called, in Avatar sounded ridiculous; I laughed out loud at dialogs like ""We MUST fight for Helium"" in this one. It's even funnier thinking back at it, and thinking how they would have sounded if they actually HAD helium available when recording the dialog...How Disney thought they could cash in on the ridiculously large budget, using mainly actors no one had heard about prior to this movie, using a literary hero most had long since forgotten, is completely beyond me. Taylor Kitch is anything but convincing as the hero in this movie, and most of the supporting cast, in addition to being mostly second rate actors, are further drawn down by the cheesy looks of their alien beings, which ***like I said*** before looked like straight copies out of better sci-fi movies, and the laugh-out-loud cheesy dialog they have to deliver.It's all made worse that the plot in it self is at best ridiculous, at worst completely illogical, cheesy and way drawn out as though you're trying to smear a small piece of butter onto a much too large piece of bread. Is it entertaining? Only as much as some of the dialog or plot elements can actually make you laugh out loud in all their cheesiness. For me that was three times. The rest of the movie was boring and ridiculous. And yes, I know it's a sci-fi/fantasy movie, that requires you to accept things you normally wouldn't. But pretty much all sci-fi and fantasy movies of the past have one thing in common, which makes it all the easier to accept their fantasy; they are not set on Earth or anywhere near it. Because they know that once you set it on Earth, and especially in a historic context, such as this one, people will question your fantasies more, and hold them up to Earth logic and, in this case, history. And on that level this fails big time. It doesn't really help that John Carter ends up on Mars, and that most of the action takes place there, either, because it's still too near to what we know and accept. Try as I might, I was simply not able to look past all of that, and let myself get drawn into the fantasy, and the alien makeup and effects didn't make it any easier, since it looked exactly like things we've seen before, which for people who've seen many movies easily makes you care more about that than what they are trying to convey in the story. So notes to Disney; when making a $275m sci-fi movie; 1. don't use no-name actors, 2. don't set them in our Solar system and 3. don't make everything in the movie look exactly like other movies (not set in our Solar system, by the way) we've seen before. It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to 4. give your McGuffins better names, and make the dialog sound more believable either.Avoid this movie at all cost. It deserves to be lost and forgotten, and never spoken of again. With a rating of almost 6.6 I had some hope for this, but I ended up even more disappointed than I was with Avatar, which also was a huge copy-fest (basically Dances with Wolves with big Smurfs for the Indians), which I hardly thought possible.

A little something here and a little something there, but overall, the first bit is rather slow. It was interesting, but it was hard to follow. I did not find it scary at all. By the time it got to the end, I wasn't really sure what was going on anymore. I would not recommend this movie to any horror movie lovers. Actually I probably wouldn't suggest it to anyone. It was a total waste of time, but the plot was just off and the movie never really drew me into it. It never really made me want to glue my eyes to the screen.

I will watch it again and again.I definitely recommend it for those looking for a romantic comedy that has well developed characters and a storyline that is easy to follow without being too cliché. In my personal opinion it is refreshing and worth at least a one time watch. In regards to the age difference, who cares? Sandra looks great for her age and they are both professionals who know how to portray their characters correctly. They have amazing chemistry together, they are both hilarious and when you combine them together, they completely rock and take control of the screen. ***Like I said***, I will be watching it several times, especially on those nights when I need a good romance with a good laugh.",True
11465,27 August 2013,RyanEberhart,Resident Evil (2002),10.0,"For those of you that played the video game of Resident Evil I am sure you had a lot of fun playing. Unfortunately, I don't think I ever did play the game, at least not outside of an arcade version. Certainly not on Playstation or Sega or Nintendo. Yes, I am that old.Anyway, I love these movies. There is not any one part of any of these movies I don't like. If I could watch them all the time I would. Not because of the walking dead, but because Milla Yovovich is hot! It doesn't hurt that we see Milla almost nude a couple of times and there is a nipple glimpse; I won't call it a nipple slip, it was there on purpose.Anyway, ***like I said***, there is literally nothing about any of the Resident Evil movies I don't like. However, as has become my custom in my reviews I have to list my all time favorite scenes. There are three I absolutely love.The first is the scene where the group of soldiers along with Alice (Milla Yovovich) and Spence (James Purefoy) attempt to turn off the Red Queen. Four of the soldiers enter a corridor which leads to the Red Queen's mainframe; after opening the door to her mainframe, the Red Queen closes the doors at both ends and traps the four soldiers. The Red Queen activates her defenses, in the form of lasers; first one that travels along one line, then one that moves up and down depending on if the soldier jumps or crouches, and finally a laser that turns into a grid and slices through the last soldier.I like a lot of the scenes where Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) is the macho soldier. At one point she tells another character to ""blow her"", hilarious. Several scenes into the movie after being bit, Rain is taunting the zombies by dripping blood from a wound in her hand down from pipes the group (Alice, Rain, Spence, Matt and Kaplan) is crawling along.The second scene I like is when the remaining members of the group, minus Kaplan, figure our that Spence is the one who released the T- Virus. Alice attempts to stop Spence's escape but he does so anyway, after a long speech how he did everything for Alice. In the end Alice doesn't buy anything that Spence says and he leaves. But Spence doesn't get far. He is soon killed by a Licker, a mutated monster that is hunting the survivors.The final scene I like is when the Licker attacks the train as the survivors are trying to make their way out of the Hive and the Mansion. The Licker claws it's way to the control end of the train, scratching Matt's arm in the process. When it reaches the controls of the train it attacks Kaplan and kills him, then goes after Alice, Matt and Rain. While Alice and Matt are fighting the Licker, Rain finally turns into a zombie. Now Alice and Matt have to fight the Licker and Rain. Alice traps the Licker's tongue with a pipe and stabs it with another pipe trapping it, yelling to Matt to open the doors to the undercarriage. Matt does this by shooting Rain in the forehead forcing her back into the button for the doors. The Licker falls through the door and from the electricity of the third rail catches fire. Alice closes the doors and cuts the tongue of the Licker letting it tumble away from the train.I said it before, and I'll say it again. I love these movies. I give this one 10 stars out of 10.",True

Not only reading his autobiography, listening to his speeches like sermons; but also vehemently using his innovations for a long time now, I regard this maverick beyond any innovator in the contemporary world. To be frank, myself despite being labeled as fickle minded, the life and the qualities that Steve possessed have never ceased to dazzle me. The qualities I specially adore about him include his impeccable lust for finer details ***like rejecting about even 100 shades of white while selecting one for mac book, his love for simplicity where he follows Picasso when he said*** that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, his audacious & visionary brilliance which was imaginative in all aspects and bestowed him with the ability to see through the consumer stratagem where he believed that customer doesn't know what he wants by exemplifying Ford : if Henry Ford would have asked people what they want, they would have replied - faster horse and we never could have the cars. Too much admiration for this man seems quite strange in post supposed to be about my movie experience but it has been done deliberately to realize the film makers that they have either missed them or just showed them in a jiffy. Rather, his darker side which relates to his personal problems with his first wife and refusal to recognize his daughter, his rude behavior with his colleagues and employees alike have been emphasized more impetuously. In short, the movie seems to be pretty much out of balance as long as it brands itself to be the biopic of Steve Jobs. Not only this, the movie ends very abruptly relieving the best part of his life where he comes up with many innovations, his affair with pancreatic cancer etc.Acting also seems 'over-acting' in some parts of the movie. It's also hard to explain why director spent so much money directing a part of movie in India when actually he didn't want to show too much of Jobs' India's experiences. Two favorable points were that the facts, although very few, weren't played around with and that the movie drained no more than two precious hours.For a Steve Jobs fan, it was not only a disappointing but an EXTREMELY disappointing biopic. At the end of the movie, I just wished if Steven Spielberg could have directed this film with Daniel Day Lewis putting up his brilliant method acting skills.",True

This is the best sport boxing drama of all time, I have ever seen. I would say ""Rocky"" and ""First Blood"" are the best movies in the franchise that Stallone filmed them. They started all. I am a huge Stallone fan I love him to death and the first original Rocky movie is the best one in the franchise. I love this film to death and it is Sylvester Stallone's best, best, best acting performance of all time.""His whole life was a million to one shot.""Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is a down on his luck Philadephia southpaw fighting at local club. When the world heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) choooses him as an unlikely opponent in his championship bicetennial fight, he's given the chance of a liftime. What wa soriginally planned as a publicitystunt becomes a chance for Rocky to prove himself as a prizefighter. While training with his cantnkerous maneger (Burgess Meredith). He also struggles to win a heart of his best friend's shy sister Adrian (Talia Shire). With the love of Adrian on his side, Rocky tries to overcome the odds, fighting with all his heart in the glorious and brutal finale.Rocky was writen by Sylvester Stallone himself, when he saw the boxing match against Chuck Wepner vs Muhammad Ali who went all 15 rounds to distance and he pretty much had no chance. The inspiration for Rocky was boxer Chuck Wepner and Sly wrote his own story based on that boxer. He knocked on all doors asking studios if they interested in a boxing drama most of the studios rejected Sly. Until United Artists was interested in to making the film with Sly in the lead. Directed was beautiful by John G. Avildsen who directed beautiful this masterpiece sports boxing movie. John G. Avildsen 8 years later directed The Karate Kid (1984) another competition's sports drama movie and actor Rob Garrison who played Tommy from Cobra Kai just died this friday and it is sad. John G. Avildsen also past away two years ago both director and actor from The Karate Kid (1984) rest in peace they are both missed.Butkus Stallone was a real dog in this movie that Sly used to own a dog. In the early 1970's. Sly was poor and almost homeless. He had no money for him and his dog Butkus so he sold his dog for $40 so that he could buy a food. Just like his character Rocky. He does the best he can to get buy. He fights in the boxing club with Spider Rico (Pedro Lovell) wins the fight but get's paid only $40. He is a collector for Tony Gazzo (Joe Spinell). That's what Rocky did in this movie for the living to get buy, he was a good heart man. He grab a homeless poor men and he walked him in to the bar. After studio payed Sly for the script for Rocky movie, Sly tracked down the owner of that dog and he bought his Butkus dog back for $15,000. So Butkus the dog was in this movie Stallone's real dog.It is a beautiful story, I love how they shot the mean streets of Philadephia how they showed people at night walking the streets. I love the beautiful shots. How people on the street were that time and not today. I love the training seqquence how Rocky was runing trough a junkyard towards Columbus Blvd) I love the song Gonna Fly Now by Bill Conti. I love the dialouges Mickey: OK, I'm gonna tell ya! You had the talent to become a good fighter, but instead of that, you become a legbreaker to some cheap, second rate loanshark! Rocky: It's a living. Mickey: IT'S A WASTE OF LIFE! The final fight on the finale between Rocky and Apollo was realistic it was real and the fight was for real. in 2014 when I was by my dentist for my tooth problems and I saw all that blood all that hurt I told my dentist this is ***like Rocky I bloody match and he smiled and he said*** you said that well see you next round. I love this movie to death, It is a beautiful sports drama.Burgess Meredith as Mickey, Rocky's tranior and menager did a great job he was the second heart of the film. The acting from everyone was realistic. Carl Weathers was great as Apollo Creed, he was excellent. Burt Young as Paulie was still great and funny in this movie. I don't like Creed (2015) spin off movie because it was remake of Rocky this movie and Adonis Creed was just a rich kid who had a daddy isuess and he quit his job to become a boxer for no reason. Rocky is the underdog, he is a poor and good heart. In my opinion Rocky is MILES way better movie than Creed movies nowdays and Raging Bull (1980) I never saw that film and I don't care.Rocky is Sylvester Stallone's best movie her ever did, it is the underdog story in a sport cinema boxing masterpiece. Rocky IV, Rocky III, Rocky Balboa (2006) and Rocky II are my top four best Rocky movies of all time.",True
12852,1 October 2019,tm-sheehan,Ride Like a Girl (2019),10.0,"My Review- Ride ***Like a Giri
My Rating 10/10Yes ! A 10:10 from me I've often said*** when the Australian film industry does well in movie making it usually does very well.Ride Like a Girl should be seen by everyone Australian or non Australian it's such an inspirational film.
I know nothing about or don't really care for horse racing but must admit even I was impressed when Michelle Payne became the first woman jockey to win The Melbourne Cup in the long history of the race.Director Rachel Griffiths has crafted a winner in every way with this fine film.The entire cast of actors are superb especially Adelaide born actress Teresa Palmer who is cast as Michelle Payne, she's authentic, believable and sensitive in a feisty way .
She had to be when you realise the obstacles she had to convincingly portray.
Male dominated discrimination like in no other profession portrayed in the film as just a fact of life back then until Michelle crashed through the starting gate. Teresa's relationship with her father is Sam Neil's best performance in my opinion in many a film,he's a good actor but he's great in this film.
He had to be ! losing his wife and mother of his ten children left to bring them up as a single Dad . He then loses his daughter Michell's sister in a racing fall which naturally builds up the tension between his remaining racing daughter Michelle, he doesn't want to lose another.Michelle Payne's actual brother Stevie plays himself in the movie not an easy ride I'd imagine but he's tremendous and must be so proud of his sister. His performance and his actual real life achievements are an inspiration to any man or woman with Downs syndrome.The cinematography is magnificent, the editing perfection and the score by David Hirschfelder is stirring and impressive.Accolades all round from me especially to Director Rachel Griffiths her experience in film and television working with great directors has certainly paid dividends as I hope the success of Ride Like a Girl should reflect at the Box Office.I rarely score a film 10 but if this was an American movie it would receive an Academy award nomination in every category from this film goer.",True
13029,7 February 2016,schroeder-gustavo,The Hateful Eight (2015),10.0,"The Hateful Eight is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh among others. It really is a star filled cast.First of all props to Tarantino for releasing this film even after the script was leaked back in the day. Thank you for releasing this movie. I have to say, I applaud his efforts. I really do. He is really trying to pay homage to the westerns of the 1960's and just from the opening you get that feel. Everything from the locations to the shots makes this feel like a legitimate western. As much as I love Tarantino's previous film, Django Unchained, it didn't really feel like a western to me, but a really good Tarantino film. The Hateful Eight feels like a western. Something that really helps add to that feel is the score by Ennio Morricone, who composed the scores for many westerns back in the day, including The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.Now, did the movie HAVE to be released in 70mm? No, I don't think so, but the Roadshow showings this movie had and the effort Tarantino put into it makes me respect him even more because that's just the love he has for cinema. He makes every movie of his so cool, but it seems effortless and that's one of the many things I love about him as a filmmaker.Every performance in the film is spectacular, but I really particularly enjoyed the performances by Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins. They were great in the film. Some people I heard saying this movie was boring, which at least for me it really wasn't. The movie is 3 hours long, it did not feel that long, at all. I can see why people would find the lack of locations maybe boring for them, but really I find that lack of locations the reason why this movie succeeds for me. Most of the movie takes place in a cabin, which works great because you feel the isolation, you feel the tension building up to the climax of the film. The use of location was great, it actually felt cold as I sat in the theater and watched this. I love that they filmed in real snow, as well. Every single chapter in the film is great and the story does advance rather slowly, but this is a movie that relies on that tension that is a result from that slow pace and from the amazing dialogue.I found the cinematography great, the direction was great, the performances as well. There is to me but one, I don't want to call it a flaw, because it really isn't, but it's more of an observation, but I want to mention it. Without spoiling anything from Django Unchained, I want to relate something from that film to this one. You can say that the ""meat"" of the film in Django is everything that happens until the last few minutes of the film. And what happens at the end of Django (which is actually great, by the way) feels just like a cherry on top of the film. It doesn't really advance the plot anymore, but it gives the viewer a certain kind of satisfaction. The same goes for The Hateful Eight. You are constantly trying to figure out throughout the first chapters of the story, who the bad guy or guys is/are, and it's pretty cool, it's much like playing Clue with Tarantino characters and dialogue. So as the plot advances, you realize this person isn't the bad guy and then this person and so on, so you start discarding characters, but there is a point in the movie where just abruptly find out who the bad guys are and their real motivation. After that, in Tarantino fashion, you know what's coming. What happens next feels like the movie is almost over, but the movie gives the viewer a certain satisfaction. Now, ***like I said***, this isn't really a complaint or a flaw but it's an observation in the last Tarantino films.There is a part of the movie where Daisy starts playing the guitar and singing a song, I loved every single thing about that. It was directed perfectly and the tension just starts building up. It's one of my favorite scenes in the movie.That being said, I loved the Hateful Eight. I am sure I even liked it more than Django. You can nitpick all you want and you may or may not like Quentin Tarantino as a filmmaker, but you can't deny the fact that the man puts so much love and effort into his films. That has to add something to it. Like many Tarantino films, the Hateful Eight doesn't feel like a movie, it's an experience, kind of trip back in time to the great films and times of the past. The Hateful Eight is a great film.",True

This movie is brilliantly subtle...It feels like an east coast type of movie...Staid characters and minimum dialog...Actions speaking louder than the words....The brooding is almost frantic, while being laid back simultaneously...Interesting pace too, it doesn't pull or push you along, more like taking a trip you know is gonna have a nice payoff when you get there...Watch, if you appreciate a well paced and interesting movie, you'll be glad you did...:)",True

Christopher Walken knows what happened, but he'll never tell. He's conspicuous in his silence. Nothing has been heard from him.

13193,7 February 2016,vispateresa,Brothers & Sisters (2006–2011),9.0,"First of all, let me tell you that I haven't watched a TV series in ages (the last one I remember watching is ""Brideshead Revisited"" – a BBC production - back in 1981). I have to say I can't stand any of today's series – either American, British or Italian. I hate medical, detective and police series; in a word - all the popular series of these days, since they are all incredibly violent and gory – at least, for me. One evening I was idly zapping in front of the television when I found one of the first episodes of ""Brothers and Sisters"": I was pleasantly surprised since the characters were not annoying, nor impossibly beautiful; the plot was not silly like ""Friends"" and, most of all, there was a certain true-to-life atmosphere that made me continue to watch. So I borrowed the whole series from the library and I am now watching episode 80, something I would have never imagined. First of all, as I wrote, I ***like all the characters, especially Sally Field who is an incredible actress (like some other reviewer said***, she is one of the best actresses ever).She can make you feel all of her emotions (whether she's happy, sad, anxious) and I think she's just great in her role as a mother who is always anxious for her children (she reminds me of the typical Italian mother).At times, she's just adorable with all her weaknesses and sometimes you wish you could enter the screen and embrace her. She can make you laugh and cry at the same time, especially when her heart is broken (look at her face when Simon leaves: she deserves an Oscar for that alone). You can see her all enthusiastic about a new date, as if she was a teenager, and you genuinely feel sorry for her when her expectations are disappointed. Then there's Kitty; she too is adorable (I confess I had seen her only in a couple of episodes of ""Ally McBeal"" but didn't like the series), whereas I like her here a lot. I find her a very good actress and she gives us a multifaceted character with all her strengths and weaknesses. All in all, all actors are very good and likable, you get to love each one of them for different reasons; let me just mention the very good Rachel Griffiths, who really surprised me (I saw her some 15 years ago in ""Muriel's Wedding"" and would've never expected such career).(Edited just to add how much I like Matthew Rhys and Dave Annable as well. Matthew is not only handsome but incredibly fun, I can't wait to see him in other films/series).I would also like to mention the work of the directors, which I find excellent: I like the pace and the rhythm, they manage to keep the attention of the viewer very high all the time. Plus, I like the fact that even the most dramatic moments are alternated with some humour. Last, but not least, we have some groundbreaking issues (at least, here in Italy) like a homosexual couple, two men kissing, the surrogate mother, and so on. Now that I'm approaching the end of the series, I wish there was another one similar to this one!",True

However, in that freezing weather, without any medication, proper care or food, after being choked and put through the mental anguish of seeing his son killed right in front of his eyes, he managed to make it all the way to his first meal.

13398,8 February 2016,dave-mcclain,Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (2016),9.0,"Pride and Prejudice AND ZOMBIES?? It sounds strange. It is. It sounds like a bad B-movie, but is it? ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" (PG-13, 1:48) has a very unusual premise but not a unique one. If you're tempted to dismiss this movie as disrespectful to classic literature, or history (or zombies), I'd encourage you to consider the following two movies: In 2005, Indian and British filmmakers got together to produce a Bollywood-style film called ""Bride & Prejudice"". It was loosely based on ""Pride and Prejudice"", Jane Austen's classic 1813 novel about conflicts and misunderstandings among young men and women of different social standing. In 2012, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" created an alternate history by merging the personal background of the man who would become the 16th President of the United States with legends and fictional characteristics of the so-called ""children of the night"".Worldwide, ""Vampire Hunter"" earned double what it had cost to produce. Box office receipts for ""Bride & Prejudice"" tripled that movie's budget. And then there are other alternate versions of history, such as 2009's ""Inglourious Basterds"", which doubled the money spent on its production, and fictionalized versions of history like 2003's ""The Last Samurai"" whose worldwide take was three times its budget.What's more, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" was co-written by Seth Grahame-Smith, who wrote the book on which that movie is based – and had previously written the 2009 mash-up novel ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"", the book on which the 2016 movie is based. So, if movies ***like this aren't unheard-of, and they make money, the most important question that remains is whether ""Pride + Prejudice + Zombies"" (as it's also written) is in the same class as the other films mentioned*** above.Much like the characters in Jane Austen's original work, in this film, there's a wealthy Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) whose pride is misinterpreted as arrogance by Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James), an independent young woman who tends to let first impressions and unproven stories prejudice her attitudes towards others. Darcy and Elizabeth clash at first, but eventually feel drawn to each other. UN-like Jane Austen's story, this is all happening as Darcy and Elizabeth are trying to fend off the zombie apocalypse.In this film's version of history, Great Britain has become afflicted with a plague brought to its shores from its overseas empire. London has been walled off by the Grand Barrier and is further protected by the Royal Moat, a giant trench which encircles the city as well as an area of farm land known as the In-Between. Britain's undead roam the countryside in fairly small numbers, but are a persistent concern to the country's landowners and there's something different about these zombies. They're not as fast as the flesh and brain eaters in ""World War Z"", but they are more intelligent than those in TV's ""The Walking Dead"". And there are rumors that the apocalypse described in the Bible's Book of Revelations will be a zombie apocalypse, complete with the biblical Four Horsemen and led by the Anti-Christ.For the sake of self-preservation, British families who can afford it send their children (male and female alike) to Japan or China in order to receive training in martial arts and various kinds of weaponry. Elizabeth and her four sisters are especially skilled warriors who are encouraged in their training by their father (Charles Dance). On the other hand, their mother (Sally Phillips) is more focused on marrying off all five of them as quickly as possible – so they can be protected and supported. At a nearby ball, an eligible bachelor named Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth) sets his eyes on Elizabeth's older sister, Jane (Bella Heathcote). Soon afterward, Elizabeth is being pursued by the awkward and obnoxious Parson Collins (Matt Smith). She has no interest in the Parson, or in the growing affections of Mr. Darcy, especially after what she hears about him from a British soldier named Wickham (Jack Huston), a man from Darcy's past. The relationships just get more complicated and more challenging as the story progresses. This is, after all, a period romance and an ongoing struggle to avoid getting eaten by zombies.""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is tough to describe and do it justice. It's strange, but not too weird. It's a B-movie premise that does not play like a B-movie. Production values are high, the acting is strong and Burr Steers' writing and directing tell a well-constructed stylized story. And the movie smartly avoids extremes. The zombie killings are not overly gory and the romance isn't too sappy. The various elements of Austen's tale and the book's zombie story work together remarkably well – better than most Movie Fans would probably expect. In short, Pride + Prejudice + Zombies = a great time at the movies. ""A""",True

Scott (well, what can I say?), I didn't really miss when he spat his dummy and left. I get the feeling that the big ""split"" between Tom, Jordan and Richard was all for the show. They still seem to be very friendly on screen. If there was a real split resulting in Tom and Jordan being sacked, I couldn't see Richard having the relationship he has with them.

I was so into Friends at that time, and couldn't accept the idea of watching another sitcom. Well, at least at the very first. Only a few episodes through the first season, I was totally intrigued. The show is a masterpiece. It has every element a comedy sitcom would need to have. It teaches you the true meaning of friendship and love at times. The gang's amazing friendship is what we all dream of having. Moreover, having Barney Stinson ""Neil Patrick Harris"" added so much to this show. Even though, some people hated his character for the terrible things he does to women, it's a comedy show after all, and he nailed his part. The irony that he's gay in real life, if anything, it shows how much of a topnotch actor he is. I mean seriously, without him, the show would've lost a lot of fun. Of course Robin Scherbatsky's charisma, Ted mosby's kind heart, Marshall and Lily's naivety also added a lot. By the time you finish the show, you feel ***like you've said*** goodbye to your friends.

13567,8 February 2016,jamesjbutler-18009,Xenoblade Chronicles (2010 Video Game),9.0,"Xenoblade Chronicles is, ***like I said*** in the summary, a fantastic game to own. It is an epic that revolves around the young boy Shulk and his sword, the Monado, as they set out on a quest to avenge their friend. This quest later turns into a larger than life story that will revolve around Shulk's ability of foresight. The world of Xenoblade is massive. It takes place across the bodies of two gigantic titans. The Bionis, where all living, organic beings originate, and the Mechonis, which is where all mechanical beings originate, were locked in a battle that ended with both titans weakening each other to the point of exhaustion. Life would later spring up on these titans. The story of Xenoblade starts off at the Battle of Sword Valley. The Homs, basically humans, are fighting off a large force of Mechon, machines that eat Homs. You play as Dunban and hold back a large horde of Mechon using the Monado. The game does a one year time skip, and you're now controlling Shulk. After some normal, peaceful time in Colony 9, a Mechon attack results in Shulk's friend and love interest Fiora's untimely death. This attack is also where Shulk first wields the Monado. Shulk and his friend Reyn depart from the colony and promise to avenge Fiora. Xenoblade's gameplay is a perfect mix of combat and world exploration. Exploration and side-questing rewards you with experience points. Side quests are entirely optional, you don't need to do any to progress the story. However, it is ideal to do as many as possible in order to be at a safe level. This game doesn't punish you directly for not doing side quests, but you will notice the game becomes more difficult if you do fewer side quests.Xenoblade's combat system is so deep, but at the same time user friendly. It's complex enough to earn its own review. The combat in Xenoblade draws inspiration from MMO's with attacks that are unique to a certain character that have cool down times. These attacks, known as arts, can inflict status conditions on the enemy. You have your standard ones, such as poison, paralyzation, blaze (which is basically burn), and others.There are also unique statuses. These include break, topple, and daze. An enemy with a break status can be toppled, and a toppled enemy can be dazed. Positioning can also have an influence on damage. Some arts might do more damage if you're behind the enemy. Every character has a unique talent art too. These talent arts can draw aggro, do heavy damage, or allow access to more arts. Shulk's Monado will give him visions of powerful attacks that are coming. This will give players a warning, only give them a certain time to react them. Warning a party member takes one meter from the party gauge. If you have three meters in you party gauge, you can unleash a powerful chain attack. The scope of Xenoblade is astounding for a Wii title. The environments are all unique. And at a distance, everything looks amazing. Models up close do look muddy, and that's the only reason I don't give this game a 10 out of 10. It does look like an early Gamecube game in terms of close up looks which can sometimes be a tad distracting. The soundtrack is astounding, bringing out emotions of sadness or excitement depending on the scene. The battle themes are iconic, and the world exploring themes are charming. Character development progresses perfectly, and you feel like you've known them way longer than the story 70 hour story. Completionists are staring down a large beast. It will take the upside of 121-130 hours to complete Xenoblade Chronicles.This is a massive undertaking with a great reward in form of an amazing story, great characters, and rewarding accomplishments. It's a great game to have regardless of your status with JRPGs. If you're a veteran to the genre, you'll be right at home. If you want to get into these types of games, Xenoblade is a friendly startup game.",True

It might come off as a little bit of a ""Psycho"" ripoff at times, but since I've heard De Palma was a big fan of Hitchcock, I think any similarities are intentional and in homage to Hitchcock rather than trying to rip him off.I only had one minor complaint about the movie, I feel like they REALLY went into detail at the end to make sure you knew what happened, which was OK, but I feel like they didn't have to explain it as thoroughly as they did. It's almost like the filmmakers were afraid the audience wouldn't pick up on what was going on, or if they did, were afraid they wouldn't understand why what happened did happen.I think had they had a little bit more faith in the audience's ability to understand what was going on it would've been just a bit better, but ***like I said*** it's a minor complaint.I give it an eight out of ten!

14933,30 August 2011,Ryan_MYeah,The Beaver (2011),8.0,"Today, I'm gonna be talking about The Beaver, Jodie Foster's outstanding portrait of depression, redemption, and everything in between.The opening five minutes quickly, and effectively explains the story of depressed toy company executive, Walter Black (Played by Mel Gibson), and the conflict in his family, including that with his wife, Meredith (Played by Jodie Foster), aching to return to the way things were, and his sons, his older of which, Porter (Played by Anton Yelchin), who keeps post it notes of similarities between he and his father, obsessed with, and scared of the thought of ending up just like him. Having been fed up with it all, Walter attempts to take his own life, but is foiled by a beaver puppet he'd found earlier in a dumpster. He uses it as a sort of therapeutic treatment (Complete with a flawless Cockney accent) in order to restore his long lost zest for life.Even though this sounds like it might lead to hilarity, that's actually not quite the issue. It's a deeply thematic, and heavy handed experience. The screenplay was written by Kyle Killen, very fearlessly might I add. It was placed on an industry list of the top ten unproduced screenplays one year, and attracted the attention of Jodie Foster.A lot of the main focus is on Walter, but there's also effective focus on his family. Meredith's desire to reconnect with Walter, his younger son Henry needing a father figure, and his older son Porter rejecting him, and also in a relationship with cheerleader, Norah (Excellently played by Jennifer Lawrence, who can hopefully look forward to a LONG, healthy career).***Like I said***, most of the focus is on Walter and the puppet, and his separate personalities conflicting with each other, with the Beaver acting as a symbol of his second personality. But what about the more far fetched conclusion that The Beaver has actually gained a legitimate personality? Well, reading too far into things aside, there's something really fascinating about it that adds a slight enigma to Walter's fractured interior.Mel Gibson makes no illusion of being a professional ventriloquist, - in fact, whenever he speaks for the beaver, you can clearly see his lips moving - but he does what any good ventriloquism act should do. He completely blurs the lines between what's real, and what's an act. He approaches the role with total sincerity, and nuance. It's a quiet performance, but one with powerful emotion at its core. A standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival well deserved. Jodie Foster and Anton Yelchin also shine as Meredith and Porter.The only thing left to bring up is that the film is a bit depressing, and a tough one to chew on. But if you can get past that, please see this underrated movie! The Beaver deserves every minute of your undivided attention.I give it *** out of ****",True
14941,30 August 2011,Perception_de_Ambiguity,Vampire Journals (1997 Video),10.0,"Patrick M. Griffith may very well be the great unsung hero of cinema. The amazing command over tone in the incredibly atmospheric 'Vampire Journals' isn't solely but certainly substantially thanks to his impeccable supervising sound editing work. But at least in the industry his contribution seems to be valued, his involvement in approximately 200 productions in the 90's alone seem to be a testament to that. Not to discredit the other artists of this production, though, because this is definitely the best film I've seen in which M. Griffith had his mixer console regulating hands in.'Vampire Journals' very much is a story of vampires in which mortals mostly play the role of servants and nuisances, humans are a state of being that has to be overcome, what they certainly are not is a threat nor are they of big relevance in this film.The visuals are better shown than talked about. They are very consistent throughout, their aim is less to wow the viewer than to engulf him and to make him succumb to its Gothic temptation. It's the film's greatest strength as well as its greatest weakness because it can be straining to be immersed in it for its full running time. But this tells you that 'Vampire Journals' is a film without great faults, even the acting is surprisingly good for this type of production.Naturally there is a lot of mist in this film, it's even used indoors but it's used delicately to enhance the light. You never ask yourself: ""Why is it so foggy inside the mansion?"" It more looks like dust through which the light has to fight its way which fits the material perfectly. ***Like I said***, the visuals don't aim to impress but the relatively simple special effect of over-sized, seemingly bodiless shadows traveling alongside house facades certainly make for some striking moments in the film.The man in the lead role is an obvious choice to play an elegant Gothic type of vampire but why not if he fits it so very well. Which brings me to a potential complaint, the vampires look too obvious (even their pointy teeth are on display at all times), any human being would immediate notice that something is off with them, but that's just it, vampires secretly are the master race, so it fits into the overall concept that they have no great need to conceal themselves. It's not something that is of great relevance to the story at any point anyway.",True

And as for the storyline, as a 'decorator' there wasn't much decorating going on, and going to an antiques market ???? then there was the boy child, who takes a child to work ??Here in the UK we just see a cutesy American town dressed for Christmas, so the true geographical location is not so important as perhaps an American audience.Interesting that Donna Mills at 79 is still going strong, and good for her, but ***like all ladies who have had 'work' done, her voice sounds like she is wearing new dentures and struggling to keep them in !!!!

15868,8 December 2019,Horst_In_Translation,Die Schokoladenkönigin (2005 TV Movie),2.0,"""Die Schokoladenkönigin"" (which means ""The Chocolate Queen"") or ""Flußpferde küßt man doch"" (which means ""Hippopotamuses are supposed to be kissed"") is a German television movie from 2005, so this one will have its 15th anniversary next year. It runs for 1.5 hours like they usually do and this is based on a novel. I have not read said novel, so I cannot say if this basis for the film is also bad or if it just the movie. But I think the film is so bad that the novel cannot be high-quality. Such a decline in quality would be impossible. Now it must be said that the failure here already starts with the title. There is focus on the protagonist working at a bakery, but it's never major focus or at the center of the movie. So bad choice and as for the alternate title, the one with the animals I have no idea what they were thinking there. It does not make sense whatsoever, unless maybe the protagonist who is not too happy about her weight compared herself to a hippopotamus at one point? I don't know. Just a bad joke honestly. Now as for the film itself: You see the lead actress is Christine Neubauer and everybody who knows a bit about German television knows what to expect. Namely, stupid kitsch, horrible acting and just an unrealistic film as a whole. And it is all true. It is already a problem that she seems considerably older than her love interest in this film we have here. The latter is played by Hardy Krüger Jr. who is also somewhat well-known here in Germany, but judging from what I have seen him in he would never have had a career if it wasn't for his famous dad. Actually, the age gap is not as big between the two as you may think, but honestly they looked as if it was nearly 10 years of age, maybe even more. Now I will go a bit into detail about bad moments and scenes. First of all, I cannot even say something positive about the supporting cast here. The two protagonists' best friends are portrayed by actors who were just as bad, although it must be said that Krüger is probably not as bad as Neubauer, even if by no means he is good either. Oh and there is Ingolf Lück here too, a really great entertainer and host in my opinion and it is kinda sad he has to appear in films like this because the script really did not do him any favors at all. The best example is the kiss in front of the girl. By the way, the child actress I liked, so she was the only bright spot somehow in this movie with everything else being a huge mess. It is a pity she is not acting anymore, especially looking at how prolific she was back then, there seemed to be a tendency for her to try to have an acting career also into her grown-up days, but it seems she went for a ""normal"" life instead.Now specific scenes that were horrible: Everything related to the main character's insecurities about her weight, especially the moment when she mentions her belly and her love interest says something like if she has stomach pain because he doesn't perceive her as obese. The cringe. When Krüger's character reads the bedtime story via phone to her daughter because the babysitter could not do different voices for the characters. The cringe. I mean keep shoving it into our face that he is the best father in the history of mankind. Basically everything related to the best friends I mentioned earlier already, especially their takes on relationships and also the argument between the two women which feels really fake. The dialogue writing is a mess from beginning to end with this film. The story with the old lady. Felt completely out of place and did not fit into the film at all. The brutes hitting our likable male hero. And maybe the most, the fact that Neubauer's character is close to marrying Lück's apparently because the two did not seem one bit like a loving couple. Ridiculous. Also ridiculous the way Lück's character was written, so the audience should be manipulated by the really most simple approach ever to find him unlikable like the wine scene with Krüger. I mean there are many other scenes ***like the ones I mentioned*** and it was truly painful to watch. It could be said in the cast's favor that really nobody could have turned this material into a quality movie, however the likes of Neubauer here made it even worse. I mean the best example is also everybody drooling over Krüger. Unbearable to watch, especially the moment when the teacher tries to turn a talk about his daughter into a date with wine. Like seriously, come on. Is anybody a professional in this film? Luckily it went for only 90 minutes, slightly under, because another half hour would really have been torture. So yes, this is without a doubt one of the very worst films of the year 2005. Disastrous watch no matter which perspective you take. It is always a failure. And needless to say it also has the very bad unrealistic happy ending that feels truly rushed and never in a way where it could have happened like this in real life. I don't know what else to say about this film. I don't think language is developed yet to the point where the words and phrases exist to express explicitly how much of a catastrophe this film is. Another big mess for Neubauer, one of many in her body of work and it is a mystery how she could get cast for lead characters for years. Luckily not anymore. So stay far away from this one, the further the better.",True

The plot - what there is of it - is like a 1970's Brian Rix farce. I was expecting people to appear out of wardrobes with their trousers around their ankles.""on some level, it feels like the director is saying, ""see, this is what the super-wealthy are like, and they are just like us, aren't they?"" but if you are like one of these people, I doubt you have the self-awareness to realize how unappealing your self-centered, insulated life is!overall, it feels like a jumble, things thrown together randomly - there's the general premise, but that feels contrived (the way it gets played out) and there are unnecessary distractions, which lessen any tension that might begin to build upit has a nearly absurdist quality, and perhaps if there was some sort of apocalyptic development and they all had to confront their imminent mortality, perhaps there would be a way to salvage this hilariously terrible messGatsby goes to a poker game while thinking Ashleigh might be in great danger - so the super wealthy don't have smart phones in 2018?TV news report that makes Gatsby jealous is quite contrivedWoody's amateurish devices, which sometimes come across as charming to many viewers, come across here as just poorly renderedtowards the end, the film changes focus, from Gatsby questioning his relationship with Ashleigh to Ashleigh fending off much older males who view her as a potential ""sexual conquest,"" then we get a family drama with Gatsby; it seems like ""filler"" was needed because Woody couldn't figure out how to articulate the central dramaending is ridiculous, with inverted cinematic values!the main premise changed more than once, with none of them being at all satisfying. the protagonist decides to ""choose"" a different woman to be his romantic partner, yet he doesn't change or recognize that his view of himself was inaccurate. instead, we see Gatsby chose the ""better"" woman, which I find distasteful, at the very least (in some ways it was like the ending of ""Manhattan"" reversed); at the very least the story was flaccid and lazy.the ending makes us question if Woody has ""normal human feelings,"" because Gatsy doesn't seem to exhibit any normal attachment to Ashleigh, but rather possessiveness. if this was the case, there should have been at least one scene where Gatsby recognizes his flaws and treats Ashleigh with the respect she deserves.",True

But what a glorious movie, great story with excellent screenplay and acting, made in England and Wales as well as USA, the colour is sumptuous.John Justin plays Ahmad the dethroned king, although looking a bit pale for the job his acting is spot on, Sabu as Abu was great as well, at least he looked the part being an Indian, not quite middle east but close enough, and for a 15 year old acted really well, June Duprez was very good as the princess even though she looked more European, Rex Ingram was the definitive Djinn (Genie). Eccentric British actor Miles Malleson as the Sultan looked a bit odd, at least from the neck up. But the great Conrad Veidt played the Jaffar and he did look the part, although he must have browned up for the role, his mad stare is the benchmark for evil looks, he had it down to a tee, for me he was the definitive evil person, no one has equaled his evil look in movies since.The direction was superb, supposed to be by Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell (himself a fine director) but apparently Alexander Korda, the producer had the biggest hand in there, the music stirring, the photography excellent for the day, the special effects were a bit of a let down, but for the day was good (***like I said*** it's not right to judge a film from then on today's standards), that was just a minor quibble, another one is the use of western actors in most of the middle eastern roles but again it was a different era, I did notice there were plenty of middle easterners in the extras.And despite the last two comments, it still looks great today, I was happy to show it to my kids when they were young, and my Grandchildren nowadays.",True

I couldn't rate it more then a 7 because they make no character likeable. There's times you want to root for Hanna or be on her side and then she just does something completely left field. Also, in this world, NO ONE locks their phones lol everyone just grabs anyone's phone and has complete access, especially the second season. And boy do some of the characters have the absolute worst luck and timing and then some others have the absolute best lol nonetheless, it is a well acted, scripted, scored and shot digital series by amazon. As far as season 2, it was a little uneven for me towards the middle once everyone got to the meadow's. The girl Sandy had a dramatic character change it seems by like the 6th/7th episode. Went from being very naive and almost dim witted good ol' girl. Saying one of her friends cursed too much and reading the Bible and learning life lessons like forgiveness, to this extreme savage lol the actress who plays Hanna does extremely well. I liked the character Leo, a part of me felt like at some point in the series the character Terri Miller would have a change of heart or become empathetic to the girls before the very last minutes of the last episode. Pretty much season 2 was a reboot of a lot of season 1 ideas and concepts, but on steroids lolHad to make an edit because I'm baffled; people on here complain about how slow the episodes are, but also want plot and character development.. that takes time, duh. People complain about the show being a ""teenage drama"".. the movie got the same complaint.. lol like poeple are really saying the movie is perfect?? Gtfoh!! the show stuck pretty close to source material as far as her relationship with the girl and her family on holiday in season 1. The movie did the same except the show is capable of going further in depth to give us background and an understanding of the girl and family dynamics so we understand why everyone makes the decisions they do. The show actually made their interaction more interesting and relatable. If the show went too far from the movie, there'd be complaints regardless lol and the movie wasn't that great if you read the reviews, it's filled with flaws and plot holes galore because it tried to jam pack a million inconceivable things into a film. The show takes its time helping to elaborate and explain some ideas, or iron out the flaws in the film. Someone mention Hanna punching trees as an issue as if her DNA hasn't been modified or how skinny she is to be running with bricks in a bag and training, but fail to mention she's been living like a survivalist.. little to no calcium from milk or essential vitamins and minerals to help a body grow and develop properly. The show still makes its mistakes with internet use, as the movie did, ***like someone mentioned*** before she would have cleared her history with the training she had. Or in season 1 she wouldn't blast music in the car in the middle of mission to retrieve munitions, with her training.

Forget it, there are no special effects in this one, if that's what you're searching for, then go and watch ""Racing Stripes"", ""Stuart Little"", ""The Shaggy Dog"" or the master ""Babe"".In this movie animals were filmed naturally in their usual habitat, probably for hundred hours, and just for a few moments they were simply manipulated to do some uncomplicated movements, like a monkey opens a cage.The purpose is to show to the world that our way of living is affecting theirs and the problems that the baby's find in their lives after losing his closest relatives.I guess it's a movie for all family, but the kids under ten are the specific target. It was completely filmed live in South Africa, with Elephants, Lions, Cheetahs and Chimps, between many others. The animals just behave naturally and some voices show their way of thinking or communications.To me, if I could, I prefer to watch it in the original language, but as it is a children's one, it's only available in the stores in Portuguese (as I'm a Portuguese guy), without subtitles. Probably, if seen with subtitles it was even better, in my point of view movies loses some quality when seen without the original voices and I'm grateful that in my country in rarely happens, even the animated movies.",True

Just like that one, six stories are presented from different artistic perspectives, giving you an insight into one of DC's most beloved superheroes filled with great action and voice acting. However, it's still very underwhelming. I wanted more. More story, more character and plot development, more action. Just more. ***Like I stated*** earlier, if you like Batman or animation for that matter, then get this one but don't expect anything more. But if they were to do a new Batman animated series, three of my favorite shorts ""Crossfire"", ""In Darkness Dwells"" and ""Deadshot"" are PERFECT examples to take ideas and animation styles from based on those three that I've mentioned.

17939,9 December 2008,ccthemovieman-1,Welcome to the Club: The Women of Rockabilly (2001 Video),8.0,"This hour-long documentary pays homage to a group of ladies who were far lesser-known that their male counterparts in the early years of rock 'n roll. They, like Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Gene Vincent and others, were performers on the cutting edge of 'rock, singing a mixture of country and rock which became to be known as ""rockabilly."" This documentary doesn't get too political, crying over injustice of the women not getting the attention the men got, but it points it out and then shows us the talents of four female ""rockabilly"" performers of the era (mainly the 1950s). They are Janis Martin, Wanda Jackson Brenda Lee, and Lorrie Collins (with younger brother Larry as part of the ""Collins Kids."") What really impressed me was who these women were today and their wonderful attitudes about the past and the present. There is no bitterness, just some good memories and an appreciation that they are in demand today, some 40-50 years later! They all look pretty good, too, especially Brenda Lee who still has that youthful face.Lee is probably the best-known of the group. Although it's not mentioned on this DVD, her Christmas song plays over loudspeakers in malls and about everywhere in every Christmas season.It's mentioned here that Martin was ""the female Elvis,"" the first big female rocker who moved and sang like ""The King."" She's still performing, as are all the others.Jackson has some interesting stories about how she became a Christian, did Christian songs for about a decade and then was asked to come back when rockabilly was revived and has now done both ever since.Collins and her brother both look good, too, and relate about how they split up for a while with some very bad feelings but now they, too, are back and performing.That's the nicest part of this whole story that is on this documentary: the fact all are being recognized (better late than never) by a whole new generation who really appreciates their singing and playing. Nowhere are they more appreciated than in England, which has always revered the early rock and blues singers of America.Although I was impressed with every lady here, the one person who stunned me was little Larry Collins. His big sister did the singing, but seeing the old black-and-white footage of that little 10-12-year-old playing the guitar and strutting on stage like Perkins and Presley combined. He was amazing, and a great guitar player, too. ***Like the women mentioned*** here, it's too bad he never became a star, either.Whatever, all of these people come across a good folks and all of them are happy to still be entertaining people who love their music.Long live rockabilly!",True
18419,4 May 2020,Horst_In_Translation,"Ich liebe meine Familie, ehrlich (1999 TV Movie)",2.0,"""Ich liebe meine Familie, ehrlich"" is a German television film from 1999, the old millennium still, so this one is already over 20 years old. The director is Stefan Lukschy, who seems retired now but as most other projects in his body of work seem as weak as this one here, it is probably not a bad thing. He was around the age of 50 when he made this one. Also at the age of 50 was writer Krystian Martinek, whose main profession is acting, so it should be no surprise to anybody that he is also seen in front of the camera in this movie. He is still acting nowadays by the way, which may not be too good because his body of work is on the same level as Lukschy's. Their movie here is based on a novel by Anna Johann. Apparently, this is the only book she wrote that got turned into a movie. I have not read said book, so I cannot say if the problem is the adaptation here or if the book is already as flawed as this movie. Maybe a mix of both. The cast includes more familiar faces than I expected though. Suzanne von Borsody was already pretty famous back then and same is definitely true about Rosemarie Fendel. Leonard Lansink is always nice to see for me because I kinda ***like ""Wilsberg"" and it was somewhat interesting to see him play an antagonist for once, even if admittedly the way they wrote*** him as an antagonist was just painfully bad. He still makes the most of it I suppose. The for me perhaps most interesting addition here is Wolke Hegenbarth and this film was made before she even starred in ""Mein Leben & ich"" for no less than ten years. Admittedly there is almost nothing to her character in this 1.5-hour film unfortunately, but it's still nice to see her during her younger years. There is just one scene when she basically hides her boyfriend from her mother and that was pretty cringeworthy, especially the reference about the t-shirt. The female protagonist (von Borsody) has no less than four children here in this film, but they are just there really. The other daughter gets a brief reference about how the mother has to talk with a teacher because the girl faked the mother's signature and that's it. The two smaller children, both boys, do not even get that. They could have been left out of the film completely and it would have been the same movie. Oh well they get to act scared towards the end when there is a little crime story.This crime story was also the main reason why I thought this was not just a weak movie, but a bad movie. I mean the idea of the grandmother being a bit on the paranoid side with her comments about a killer on the loose were actually somewhat funny I won't deny that, but when she disappears and they actually turn this into a crime movie, still family-friendly obviously, it goes all kinds of wwrong, even if I liked the old man sitting there full of himself and telling SvB's character about how the old woman tried to kill him and instead killed herself. Of course, at the very same time the grandmother reappears. How realistic. Shake my head. That was just embarrassing. But not as embarrassing as the definitely weakest moment/sequence this film had to offer and I am talking about the balloon sequence here with the guy in charge of directing said balloon falls unconscious. Realism really wasn't the biggest strength of the writer(s) here. I mean you can include something like that, but you have to make it look credible and this certainly was not the case here. All for the sake of it. Same is true about the title character's romantic adventures. Her husband wants her back, her new romance wants a more serious relationship and the office's gigolo wants sex. Oh my, so embarrassing how they really want the audience to see von Borsody's character as the most desirable woman on the planet. Another prime example of how it all went wrong when they were trying to make a film about a strong female character. Only weak female characters will fall for that. By the way, the ending is also a joke. So she goes back to the husband who is the father of all her children? After he apparently cheated on her, after he keeps forgetting about important dates related to his kids etc. Embarrassing stuff. Yeah going back to him is really what a strong woman would do. And the evil evil boss who treats her so badly now after she refused to enter a serious relationship with him. Sigh. Oh well, I guess those people who believe anything about this movie also won't see the irony in my statement. Anyway, have you ever heard of periods of notice? Apparently the filmmakers here have not as their protagonist simply walks out of the building and she is gone and done with her job. So, overall you can definitely say this film is as bad as the title is cringeworthy. How she said these exact words at the very end was definitely not helping at all. The epitome of how they wanted us to like all the characters despite (or because of) their flaws because they are oh so normal. And as if their desperate attempt to depict the characters like that wasn't enough already, they also included it in the title. Oh well, maybe they realized their complete absence of talent won't make us understand said message throughout the movie and that is why they picked this title. In any case, it's a massive thumbs-down for me. Definitely among the very worst German movies of 1999. No clue why this is still shown on television. I guess Regina Ziegler Filmproduktion always finds away to being their garbage to the masses, no matter how much time has passed.",True
19266,25 February 2020,ofpsmith,The Man Who Saved the World (1982),1.0,"The Man Who Saved the World (more commonly known as Turkish Star Wars) is the most manic and insane movie I've ever seen. I've known about this film for a few years but I've only seen it now. If you know nothing about it, and have stumbled upon this movie whilst aimlessly surfing IMDb, let me give you a rundown. Turkish Star Wars has that unofficial title as the film is both from Turkey and makes copious use of unauthorized stock footage from Star Wars: A New Hope which they definitely did not have the rights too. Moreover, the soundtrack is shamelessly lifted from Raiders of the Lost Ark, albeit with a very unnatural stop in the tempo whenever someone in this film is punched or kicked. The IMDb trivia section is pretty humorous and sheds some light on the film. The use of Star Wars footage stemmed from the fact that the sets were constructed on a Turkish beach, destroyed in a storm (which is going to happen when you build your elaborate film sets on a beach) and then because the studio didn't want to pay for rebuilding them they decided on bribing the security guard at a film distributor for a print of A New Hope. Describing the story is not the easiest task in the world. Just be aware that two Turkish warriors from space (although they are constantly described as being from Earth as well, I guess) are sent to this planet that was once a fragment of Earth that's been shot out into space. There they have to defeat this Wizard guy who's like a dictator like figure. More happens than that but ***like I said***, the story is hard to follow and pretty nonsensical. The film is obviously riddled with faults but it's easily a film you could have fun with. Very bizarre, but very entertaining in an unintended way.",True
19448,25 February 2020,Front-Row-Reviews,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019),8.0,"The stage curtains open ...Anybody who's anybody knows who Mr. Rogers is. We've all watched his shows, and if we haven't, we all know the song that the title to this movie is based on. And if you don't know even that, then believe me ... you are in the minority. I can't really say I grew up on Mr. Rogers. I remember watching his show as a kid, but he never really was a personal favorite of mine. I wasn't really into Sesame Street either. My show of choice back in those days was Electric Company. ""Hey - you - guys!"".And yet, here comes this documentary on Fred Rogers. It isn't his life story, but rather, it showcases Mr. Rogers during the time when Esquire magazine was doing a piece on heroes, and Fred Rogers was one of those interviewed. To be honest, the movie really isn't about Mr. Rogers at all. It is more about the impact that he had on real life reporter, Tom Junod (represented by the fictional character of Lloyd Vogel), his family, and his life. At first, when Lloyd is given the assignment, he regards it as ""fluff"" and below him. This turns out to be the most difficult assignment of his career.I remember the simplicity of Mr. Rogers and his television show. In fact, it was almost borderline ""uncomfortable"" for me to watch. It moved extremely slow and felt stilted, unnatural. After having seen this movie though, I've gained a deeper appreciation for the man and what he was trying to do for kids, and ultimately, what he did do. It really is amazing that his show ran for so long and everything he accomplished in his lifetime. But, ***like I said***, this movie was more about Lloyd and his family. Mr. Rogers never had quite that affect in my life, but I can appreciate what he's done over the years.Tom Hanks was excellent in the role, as were all the supporting actors. The movie really does capture the man and his legacy. The approach the film takes as being one large episode on the show was brilliant. The movie moves along at a deliberate pace, but then again, that's how he was. Yet, it does not lose its viewer and it will make you smile and admire what he did. I highly recommend this movie. 8 stars out of 10.",True
20033,2 September 2020,rmmil,Cobra Kai (2018– ),3.0,"The common theme I heard with most reviews regarding this series is that ""If you loved The Karate Kid, you'll love this!"" I mean, I agree for nostalgia reasons that might be true for some, but I couldn't get past the generic sitcom-ish plot lines and the occasional poor acting.The series starts strong, seeing Johnny Lawrence all grown up and down on his luck was interesting. In fact I'd say episode 1, when you don't see Danny at all (except very briefly in passing), is the best episode of the entire series, because William Zabka apparently CAN act (it's a shame he ""disappeared"" for so long), and the episode focuses almost entirely on him.Once we get to episode 2+, that's where the series starts to show it's cracks. Ralph Macchio hasn't done any real acting in 20+ years, and in his case it shows. Also, his entire family and his kid's friends are all a parade of sitcom cliches and worn out ideas.By episode 3, an intriguing series has been boiled down into the lamest and most tired story ideas, and the rest of the season is telegraphed a mile a way.Again, the nostalgia factor is a nice touch, but it's all buried under ideas that I've seen a million times in other shows.I could only stand to watch season 1, it got really boring for me midway through and it was a struggle to reach the end. Angsty generation Z plot lines do nothing for me.I heard season 2 is worse than 1, so I doubt I'll bother watching it at all.Bottom line, if you're 14-16 years old this show might peak your interest, if plot lines ***like ""He said*** we had sex...but we didn't!"" is your idea of intrigue, but I'd caution older viewers looking for Karate Kid magic to steer clear.",True

I watched this series when it aired both on TV2 Norge and Jetix, but gave up after half of the series because of what I have read about the censorship 4Kids did to this series. It's not that I didn't like this series, it was an entertaining show, but 4Kids made a big shame by butchering it down to make it more suitable for kids, same with other stuff like ""Pokemon"".So I began to watch the uncensored Japanese version online, and it was MUCH better than the US-version I saw first. The music was completely different and much better than the ""Tom & Jerry""-like music on the US cut. Some of the characters fate were completely different, as references to topics ***like death were also mentioned***. Some PG-13-like words like the S-word were also used. You can read more about the different versions on IMDb's ""Alternate Versions"" section, or alternatively google about it.Conclusion: The 4Kids version is basically an OK show to be viewed to kids. The Japanese version is a great anime which I want to recommend to any hardcore Sonic-fans who haven't seen this series yet.",True
21510,29 August 2013,raphaklopper,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003),10.0,"In 1996, the movie ""Independence Day"" by Roland Emerich proved that entertainment films, which usually come out in summer (in other words, summer movies, the ones that only serve for a good popcorn) could have a high quality in various aspects from the very story, script and performances. And Gore Verbinski and the writers of ""Shrek"" (Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) with ""Pirates"" proved that once again in big! ""Pirates"" has everything that a summer movie needs to be pure entertainment, from the romantic story of the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to the beautiful daughter of the governor of Port Royal (Jonathan Pryce), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). That begins to go awry when the weird pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) appears in Port Royal and soon after him the cursed crew of the ""Black Pearl"" led by the cruel Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush).***Like I said***, from romance to comedy and action, everything that a popcorn film needs. But thanks to Verbinski, everything can go much higher and better that we expected. Since the beginning, the film presents a superb script with a good, flowing and entertaining narrative (surprising for a entertainment film), that goes from memorable phrases to intelligent humor, and the plot really takes something pretty serious without exaggerating as other films have tried and failed. But it's not just comedy that elevates the film, is the ""tone-change"" that the film has: in scenes between Elizabeth and Will the film seems to have a dramatic tone but never gets to be boring or dry; when Barbossa and his cursed crew appear everything gets dark and kind of scary. But thanks to Jack Sparrow, at all times we have a really good and funny comic relief.The film also contains a superb direction of Verbinski in all scenes, giving the film also pretty adventurous moments when you see the great and vast Caribbean, and also epic moments of action that range from fun choreographed chase-sequences to epic battles between pirate's ships against another. Ah, speaking of pirates, Verbinski seems to have grabbed almost all the clichés of pirates and thrown in the movie: one speaker parrot on a pirate's shoulder (no, neither Sparrow or Barbossa, one seems to have something against animals and Barbossa has a annoying monkey); dirty teeth and horrible breath; the favorite drink of any pirate, rum; and the British navy with elegant gentlemen leading them against pirates, and much more! Now the performances, even Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom have a good romantic connection in their characters, their acting doesn't shine much in this movie (they shine much more in the unnecessary but great sequels that the movie had). Perhaps the reason for this is the superb Geoffrey Rush, that perfectly embodying the spirit of a Pirate since the evilness to the ""aarrgghhh"", OR the highest and memorable point of the film that is the EXCELLENT performance by Johnny Depp as the unforgettable Jack Sparrow. His performance was so weird, so fun and so good that it cost him his varied roles in films like the weird and funny guy.""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" can be one of the several examples that entertainment can simultaneously be VERY fun; well written; well-acted; well directed and contain a luxurious soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, ""Pirates"" is entertainment and popcorn-flick at its best and much more! 10/10",True

I'm still wondering what people disliked so much about the movie because I really liked it and wasn't disappointed at all - my expectations were fulfilled and I enjoyed every moment of Elysium. The movie kept me on edge of my seat since its beginning to the end, it made me hold my breath few times while watching it and I can't remember a moment when I was bored - the story was fluent and kept me interested in it for the whole screening. It was shorter than most movies today, 109 minutes may seem to be not enough for a huge movie ***like this but I'm glad it's not longer - as I said*** before, the story evolved and had no 'lazy' and uninteresting moments, it didn't concentrate on unimportant details and told only things that were needed. There was so much to look at, so much to experience - visual effects and the environment/surroundings were amazing, camera work very good, soundtrack stunning (I can't stop listening to it since seeing the movie), and actors did a great work too. It's one of the best sci-fi movies I've recently seen and I can recommend to everyone to go and see it.I liked that the main characters weren't perfect examples of bravery or leadership or whatever comes to your mind when you say a 'perfect human being', they were quite natural and believable. Matt Damon's Max was selfish and maybe a bit coward too at the beginning of the movie. Jodie Foster's Delacourt maybe seemed to care only about good and peaceful life on Elysium, but she also thought about her own career and own interests. Max wasn't only a hero and Delacourt wasn't only a villain, they were humans with both good and bad in them. In my opinion, the whole crew made an excellent movie that is definitely worth watching. One point down from total 10 for few cliché moments that seem to sneak into every (even the best) movie nowadays - those clichés for me include this story of little kid Max who promised to take everyone to Elysium or the farewell scene with sad music on the background and typical 'I'm-sorry-goodbye-speech'.

I even grow attached to the characters and share in they're pain when something awful happens, not many TV shows manage that for me now a days, which tells me that this is something worth watching.In short, GREAT show, good character build up, fun lead duo! Jolly good, Carrie on! :)",True
22179,9 February 2016,XweAponX,"The X-Files: Home Again (2016) Season 10, Episode 4",10.0,"Including our Garbage... And corpses.Hm, some IMDb Trolls really are downvoting all of the high-rated reviews. This is not Reddit, go there instead.There were so many levels in this Glen Morgan written episode ""Home Again"", with the Humorous episode out of the way, we have ***as someone said*** ""One Breath"" but also elements of ""Kaddish"" and possibly ""Arcadia"". I don't see it as any kind of rehash or repeat of previous plot lines, because the mythology is remarkably different in each one.We are responsible for what we create. Regardless of if it is a mound of trash, a child, a piece of art, a law, or a Homeless Shelter. Tim Armstrong from the bands ""Rancid"" and ""Operation Ivy"" is ""The Trashman"" - Hero of the Homeless, and creator of ""Band-aid Nose Man"" (John DeSantis) - An outward Expression of Trashman's beliefs, an expression which soon starts expressing a life of it's own, at the grisly expense of a few crooked politicians and ""Art Stealers"".Meanwhile we have the return of Margaret Skully (Sheila Larkin)- And Dana dealing with that, the end result is that she starts thinking about William again. Was it the right thing to just give him away? At the time during Season 9, it was. But the Trashman's remarks stir up groaning too deep for words. At first he sounds like my neighbor when he gets drunk, until the ""Profoundities"" emerge, he's speaking directly to Skully.The fact is, it is difficult to tell this story in 6 episodes. We've been through some of this in ""William"" and ""The Truth"" and there were some ironic parallels in Trashman's Lair, if we see what Skully sees there.As a social statement, it's mostly about how the Homeless are fought over by two factions, lets call them the ""red"" and the ""black"" for now: It doesn't really matter if these people, played by Daryl Shuttleworth and Peggy Jo Jacobs are representing a political party or something else, Mulder basically identifies them right away as being motivated by the same thing: making money off of the needs of the Homeless, one wants to shunt them away to be forgotten and make money from them, the other wants to simply make money from them. And everyone involved eventually meets Mr. Band-aid Man.It's also a little reminiscent of Season 6's ""Arcadia"" in which a man in charge of a homeowner's association is responsible for creating a huge Trash Monster. So in Kaddish, we had a bona-fide Golem, which was motivated by some kind of sense of loss and love and also empowered by Jewish Mysticism, Arcadia, in which the Garbagemonster was motivated by small infractions of someone's huge rule-book empowered by an eastern religion, eventually he is dealt with by the same unreasonable rules from his own book. Which usually happens when a religion keeps a ""god-given"" text that contains contradictory commands. This could be any religion.But Skully's reflections at the denouement of this Episode pretty much say it outright, she is still responsible for William, and just as Margaret needed to talk to her youngest child, so too will Skully need to seek our her only remaining child. In all of this, have we forgotten Emily? But Emily's story is done, William's is at this point a big Question mark.Musicwise, Glen Morgan once again shows his roots with Petulia Clark's ""Downtown""",True
22273,9 February 2016,sandnair87,Stand by Me (1986),9.0,"'Stand By Me' is told in the form of a memoir, as established writer Gordie Lachance (Richard Dreyfuss), stunned by a local newspaper item about the death of a close friend, sits in his car, remembering back to 1959. Then, in the fullness of late summer, he and three of his friends embarked on an adventure that changed the course of their very carefree existence: a journey deep into the nearby woods to find the body of one of their very own missing classmates. Weeks prior, Ray Brower had disappeared and was presumed dead by authorities; now, armed with a veiled suggestion that his remains rest by a lake near where train tracks cross through the woods, the four hike up to the woodland grave-site to discover the body, bring it back to town and be hailed as heroes by the media.The movie cuts through what might otherwise be perceived as a devastating tragedy with a sense of cheerful displacement; in turn, we find certain nostalgic amusement in the way the young characters converse over embarrassment, implausible fears, the uncertain future, camaraderie and, most importantly, bullying. They also deal with devastating pasts that feel ***like shadows looming off camera – beanpole slim Gordie is still devastated*** by the untimely death of his oldest brother, bespectacled Teddy is abused by his mentally ill father, the no-nonsense leader of the gang Chris lacks a support system and pudgy little Vern is always in the wrong place at the wrong time and often verbalizes his inner paranoia in ways the others find comical. Each is something of a social misfit, subtly played by a phenomenal young cast and in the hands of these four, it makes for a journey thick in sarcasm but laced with an underlying dread that sneaks its way into their upbeat demeanors. They cling to their innocence even as the world around them grows darker, and when the plot insists they confront the gnawing influence of reality head-on, they refuse to be broken by the experience.Director Rob Reiner has a remarkable ear for the rhythms and slang of these boys on the cusp, a keen eye for their bravado. In his effortless handling of the complexity of group dynamics, with its undeclared wars and mercurial alliances, he gracefully blends raucous comedy with intense drama and delivers a film that is as much about the loss of innocence as it is of the getting of wisdom. He cleverly inter-cuts the sobering undercurrent of pathos with frequent dialogue exchanges that are succinct, carefree and sometimes rather amusing. These exchanges become the path through which we empathize with their plight, gain perspective in their approach and, ultimately, find parallels in our own formative years. And because Stand by Me is an adult's recollection of the turning point of his youth, the film very effectively contrasts a boy's consciousness with that of a man's. Dreyfuss' dryly funny narration provides both shrewd comic relief from the juvenile melodramatics and a mature perspective of a child's crisis.Rob Reiner's bucolic, nostalgic drama is suffused with the magic of childhood and rightfully deserves its place in the heart of an entire generation.",True
22282,9 February 2016,PimpinAinttEasy,The Woman Chaser (1999),9.0,"Dear Robinson Devor, thanks for making a movie based on a Charles Willeford novel. Willeford is one of my favorite writers.The film has one of the most interesting plots ever for a crime thriller. A crooked, arrogant and vicious car salesman who is really good at his job panics at a meeting of aspiring young reps. He realizes that he is wasting his life in the 9 to 5 grind. It dawns on him that we are on this planet to be creative. So he writes a script with help from his step-father and decides to direct a film. But when his edited film fails to meet the 6 reel 90 minute length standard, the studio tries to interfere in the future of the film. The crazed car salesman/movie director embarks on a rampage of destruction.I think there is more to this film than a man trying to escape his mundane life. It is also about 20th century man's impulsive behavior without thinking about the consequences. It is also about how we are all basically mad. I mean, I found myself laughing and cheering on some of the actions of the main character. I could totally identify with him. ***Like Willeford himself said*** - ""I had a hunch that madness was a predominant theme and a normal condition for Americans living in the second half of this century."" Your film was visually arresting - full of directorial flourishes characterized by slow motions and weird camera angles and lighting. Visually, it was quite similar to noir films. I loved the way you filmed the scene in the swimming pool.The film was also pretty true to the book though you did exclude two scenes of violence. You also played with the structure a little bit.I liked what another IMDb user said about the actors - they did not look like actors. They came across as real people. This is so true. Square jawed Patrick Warburton could walk into a Russ Meyer film. His acting in the ballet dance sequence was terrific.I hope Criterion or Arrow puts out a Blu Ray of this terrific film.And I hope you make more films, Robinson Devor.Best Regards, Pimpin.(9/10)",True

Then it really started to click and find itself. It became kind of like a real sitcom, as it was a funny show that had story arcs that all progressed at whatever pace and was enjoyable to go through. In the episode before this one, for example,, Scooter, Dr. Honeydew, Fozzy, Kermit/Piggy, Sam Eagle, and Yolanda all had their own stories, big or small, and there was tons of corny puns and humor mixed in that were laugh out loud funny. Same with the episode before it. What happened here?! Apparently, behind the scenes there was a major shakeup, one of the creators left the show, as he din't like the ""creative direction"" the series was heading in. Which creative direction? Was he against the multiple arcs and great corny Muppet puns (***like back when Kermit said*** ""I feel awful,"" and Bobo said ""Falafel? That sounds great!"" I love that stuff!) or was he the one pushing for it and lost the battle? I hope it wasn't the latter! Either way, he's now gone, the show took 2 months to reboot and find itself again, and we were given this episode, one that (probably not so) coincidentally was about the fictional show the muppets produce needing an overhaul to please the networks. So I don't really care what overhaul decision the fictional show needed, but if this new episode was a taste of things to come, I'm afraid The Muppets on ABC is doomed. There was not one joke at all that had me laughing out loud and the storyline progression suddenly felt forced. Gone were any mention of Fozzy's girlfriend, Scooter's nemesis Ken, or even Sam Eagle's crush. Not only was the main story not so gripping, there were even stale moments that just felt like the show was going nowhere at all. Scary. I hope this is all just rust and the show will be back to its good self again, because the past 4 episodes showed that they have a real gem on their hands. Fingers cr...wish it luck!",True

23432,31 August 2011,tavm,The Delicate Delinquent (1957),8.0,"Just watched this, Jerry Lewis' first movie without Dean Martin, on YouTube. Meant to partially be a spoof of the ""delinquent"" films of the time, Jer does quite well in mixing his usual goofy persona with that of a more serious learner when he gets mentored by a friendly cop named Mike Damon (Darren McGavin). In fact, this was originally supposed to be Dean's role but either he balked at actually playing an authority figure or he simply just had enough of his former partner's ego to continue on with him. Anyway, whenever McGavin has fights with a female council member named Martha Henshaw (Martha Hyer) there's still some traces of the Martin-like attitude especially when he reveals to Sidney (Lewis' character) his feelings for her. Officer Mike not only has to deal with the punks that hang around Sidney like Monk (Robert Ivers) and Artie (Richard Bakalyan) but also his superior officer, Capt. Riley (Horace McMahon) who has plenty of doubts about Mike's methods. ***Like I said***, this was a good mix of comedy and drama and also, Jerry has a nice number by himself in which he drops his usual whiny voice for his more normal one (which he also does in the more serious scenes).

23439,1 September 2011,ShadeGrenade,Evil Roy Slade (1972 TV Movie),8.0,"When I saw 'Evil Roy Slade' on daytime television sometime in the '80's, I assumed it was intended to cash-in on the success of Mel Brooks' 'Blazing Saddles' ( 1974 ). The made-for-television comedy Western features a few of Brooks' supporting players, as well as employing a similar mad-cap sense of humour.John Astin ( 'Gomez' from 'The Addams Family' ) plays the titular character, an outlaw whom no-one has ever loved, a man with a fondness for wearing black and robbing banks and trains, usually those belonging to millionaire 'Nelson Stool' ( Mickey Rooney ), known in some quarters as 'Stubby Index Finger' on account of his...stubby index finger ( cowboys even sing songs about it ). Whilst robbing a bank, Slade meets and falls for ( and who wouldn't? ) the lovely schoolteacher 'Betsy Potter' ( Pamela Austen ). She wants him to go straight, and he is so smitten with her he agrees. But to do this he needs £50,000. As he does not have it ( his gang blew all their ill-gotten gains on bullets and spilt whisky ), he decides to steal it. Tired of forever being robbed by Slade, Stool brings out of retirement the legendary Marshal Bing Bell ( Dick Shawn )...***Like I said***, I thought this was a 'Blazing Saddles' knock-off until I saw it was made in 1972 - two years before Brooks' picture broke new ground ( and wind ) in comedy. It was written by Jerry Belson and Garry Marshall, the team behind the hit series 'The Odd Couple' ( Marshall later directed 'Pretty Woman' starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere ). Though as you would expect it is nowhere near as vulgar as Brooks' film, it occasionally manages to get a bit near the knuckle, such as Slade forcing a crippled man to dance by shooting at his legs, a blacksmith turning out to be a black man named Smith, and Dom DeLuise's outrageously gay psychiatrist. The director, Jerry Paris, later made several entries in the 'Police Academy' franchise.Though Rooney gets top billing, its Astin's film and he's great, though basically 'Gomez' in a stetson. Milton Berle is also good as Betsy's well-meaning uncle, who gets Slade a job in a shoe shop. When shoes won't fit the feet of one customer, Slade whacks them with a stick so as to make them swell up. The worst part for Slade about going straight is having to make do without his guns. As soon as he takes them off, he finds he cannot walk! But the film really hits its comic stride with the arrival of 'Marshal Bing Bell', hilariously played by the late Dick Shawn. The character is a parody of 'singing cowboys' such as Roy Rogers. The sight of him galloping across the prairie in a Liberace-styled white suit covered in sequins and singing a flat song on a guitar is hysterical.Funniest moment - Slade gatecrashes Betsy's wedding, only to find he has been lured into a trap. Everyone present - including the caterers - have brought along guns. The only one without is the organist!Things To Look Out For - a small appearance by Penny Marshall as a bank teller. She later became famous through playing 'Laverne' in the hit sitcom 'Laverne & Shirley'.",True
23741,1 September 2011,MsDanaGold,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World (2011),8.0,"I don't understand why this movie is getting panned so badly. No, it's not Oscar-quality, but most movies aren't. When I go to the movies my goal is usually just to have a good time, and Spy Kids: All the Time in the World fit the bill for me, with the added bonus of a message that so often goes ignored. (For the record, the movie is billed as 4D but I saw it in 2D and without the Aromascope card.) For anyone who hasn't heard much about this movie, here's a brief synopsis. OSS (I'm sorry, I've forgotten what it stands for) agent Marissa Cortez Wilson makes a deal with OSS chief Danger D'Amo: she can retire to raise a family after one last mission: capturing the villainous Tick Tock, who has stolen vital OSS information. A year later she's raising her baby daughter and trying to bond with her twin stepkids, Rebecca and Cecil, but Rebecca still resents her for trying to take the place of the twins' late mom. Meanwhile, Marissa's husband Wilbur is launching a new reality show that follows him as he tries to catch spies. Unbeknownst to Wilbur, his wife is a spy and has been called out of retirement to stop Tick Tock and his boss, the Timekeeper, from stopping time. As Marissa is dragged back into service, her niece Carmen recruits Rebecca and Cecil in an effort to revive the OSS's now-defunct Spy Kids Division.The performances range from solid to fantastic. Newcomers Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook play off each other well as the squabbling twin siblings. I hope they'll continue to do well in the future. As the kids are recruited, they learn that their dog Argonaut is actually an OSS-issue robot dog being used to supervise them. Ricky Gervais provides Argonaut's wisecracking voice, and you can tell he's having fun doing it. Joel McHale's specialty is playing the man who doesn't have all the answers but is positive he does. Wilbur Wilson is one such overly cocky character, and McHale throws himself into the role with his typical wacky aplomb. Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara return as original Spy Kids Carmen and Juni Cortez. Their roles are relatively small now, but Vega and Sabara retain the chemistry that makes them so believable as siblings. Jessica Alba proves she's more than just a pretty face, showing pathos and surprising comic timing as Marissa tries to save the world and patch up her relationship with Rebecca.Jeremy Piven gets his own paragraph because he probably has the hardest job in the movie, playing the triple roles of the Timekeeper, Tick Tock, and Danger D'Amo. While the Timekeeper is something of a stereotypical supervillain, Piven's other roles come with unique challenges. He completely transforms his face and voice as the grotesque henchman Tick Tock; in fact, I wouldn't have known it was him if I hadn't seen him on Leno and Kimmel; but his third role is the toughest. The Timekeeper turns out to be none other than Danger, who is desperately trying to reconnect with his late father after a time-travel experiment in his childhood separated them. His sorrow and regret seemed to run deeper than the D'Amos and their time-travel experiment to Piven and his own late father, a suspicion that was later confirmed in an online interview. Watching him long for what can never be was heartwrenching and made me wish I could step into the movie and try to comfort him-both Danger and Piven. Playing what is billed as a triple role but comes closer to 24 roles once henchmen, duplicates, time travel, and the elder D'Amo are factored in is fraught with physical and emotional challenges, all of which Piven handles superbly. He gives his multiple roles his all, and as a result he may have delivered one of the best underrated performances of the year.I would ***like to conclude by mentioning that Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D is already getting Razzie buzz-and that said*** Razzie buzz is largely undeserved. Go to this movie expecting nothing but a good time with a good message-you might be surprised at what you find. I was, and I can't wait for the Blu-ray so I can relive my amazing discoveries in the comfort of my own home.",True
23886,2 September 2011,Boba_Fett1138,The Big Sky (1952),8.0,"Yes, I know this is a frontier western but it yet is one that manages to feel more like an adventurous pirate movie at times. The characters travel by water and also their looks and behavior seem more suited for a pirates movie. I'm not saying all this as a complaint though, on the contrary really. I like the movie for having such an adventurous feeling and atmosphere to it. It makes this an unique sort of western, by Howard Hawks.In its setup and with its story, this foremost remains a quite simplistic movie. Basically it's a movie in which the main characters are traveling from point A to B and come across all sorts of dangers and meet new people on their way. This is an approach that often gets picked for a movie of this sort, made around the same time period but most of those movies don't really work for me, since they are often just not that interesting to follow and also way too slow in certain parts. This is even a problem I have with lots of other Howard Hawks movies but I can honestly say that this movie did actually work for me. Even though the movie definitely had plenty of slow moments in it, it never bored me because it was a very engaging one to watch.Like most of these movies do, it also builds- and relies heavily on the comradely amongst its main characters. This is a theme that quite often appeals to men, so you can also really truly call this a men movie, despite the fact that it also throws in a obligatory love-story.It's not like Kirk Douglas his performance makes this movie but his presence is still of course a welcome one. It's a movie from the very early days of his career, before he really was an household name, even though he had already earned himself an Oscar nominated and earned another one in the same year as this movie got done, for his role in ""The Bad and the Beautiful"", which is also a movie that I absolutely loved watching!It's not the type of western that's set in only the desert. ***Like I said*** before, for most part its set on a river and in the northern countryside, in which the Indians still ruled. It provides the movie with some beautiful scenery, that perhaps is not really done enough justice by the movie its black & white camera-work. But who knows, maybe the overall movie would had not worked out as well if it indeed got shot in full, bright color. So we just have to take this movie for what is and be glad for the way that it turned out to be.An adventurously entertaining-, as well as intriguing movie to watch.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",True

When we are talking about the acting, I can say that I was quite surprised how decent it was. Aimee Teegarden and McDonell did really good job with their roles. Their story was predictable ( like the whole movie in general), but it was nicely done. It was touching, softly and for someones heartbreaking. All of the characters were interesting, likable and pretty good to see them again in another scene. I have to admit, that it was rare movie with all likable characters in my case and opinion. Again, there were a lot of them, and because of that, we can't reach full character development, which is weak minus, but it happens with this movies. Soundtrack of this movie is great. It perfectly matches with all of the scenes. Cinematography was also great. All places in the movie were very beautiful and interesting. Of course, just ***like I said***, movie is predictable, sometimes corny and unrealistic, but that doesn't mean that it's bad. It's just there to add some charm.

Please Sho Man next time try to get Shaan in your movie as he get the grip of your scripts and acts his heart out. Don't know why his acting is not recognized in Pakistan, India for Khuda Ke Liye. My recommendations, ShoMan exploits the acting of Pakistani Industry as he knows where to hit the hammer. Shaan please quit Punjabi crazy ass movies and stop ruining your acting courier. Punjabi Movies are dead after the death of the greatest and Legend Mr. Sultan Rahi, He was the best there is and was and nobody can be like him.",True
24037,4 May 2020,dalobbyist,Penny Dreadful: City of Angels (2020),3.0,"This show should not include the words 'penny dreadful' in the title. Even though it is done by the original creator, it has nothing to do with the original series. Nothing. At all.
Sorry, the German doctor was in the original show.
Very poor casting, acting and writing. One has to wonder how many takes were needed for the beach scene and the horrible German accents.
This is daytime tv with the hint of something macabre around the corner. Well, the audience deserves something more after two shows of what, ten in the series?
I read articles before the series aired that it was going to be very different but, at least it must be entertaining.
I think, ***like another reviewer stated***, that series creator John Logan was working on a series but HBO decided to attach the words penny dreadful to the series to attract attention because it looked like this series would not be a hit.
The cast. Natalie Dormer, Brent Spiner, Nathan Lane etc cannot carry their roles here. Not one actor in the show provides any gravitas to cement this disaster of a show. Although, Daniel Zovatto is good, not as a detective in the 1930's.
I was so let down after watching the second episode that I went back and watched the first show of the original just to erase the bad taste I received from this certainly dreadful failure.",True

25138,5 July 2020,reddiemurf81,Terminator Salvation (2009),8.0,"I'll never for the life of me understand why this movie didn't do well at the box office.
I give it at least a 7.8 rating, at least. If not an 8. Was the movie without flaws,, well no. How many movies are without flaws? Not many. There were several spots I thought could've been done a lil better. A few scenes kind of transitioned weirdly,, and when Marcus came out of the pit, covered in mud and yelled up to the sky,,, that was kind of laughable,,, but It's forgivable (after all,, I'm not a filmmaker).
Other than that,,, I don't get what the problem was.After the ending of T3,, this setting is pretty much where I saw the story going. I was overjoyed to hear that Christian Bale was taking on the role of John Connor (this was after Batman Begins, and TDK). I think he brought a great amount of energy and intensity to the role. I liked Howard getting cast as his wife. She's always great. Most of the remaining cast was fairly unknown to me. I didn't know what to think of Sam Worthington playing a Cyborg/Terminator who thinks he's human,, however after seeing it in the theater, and now again (11 yrs later),, I think his character brought a lot to the story. (Spoiler alert!!) He has no clue that he's part machine until he's involved in an explosion, and loses some skin. Even when John Connor is interrogating him, Marcus swears he has no clue of how he got this way (and he's telling the truth! He was killed by lethal injection in 2003,, then he wakes up in 2018,, that's enough to make anyone lose their minds). Anyways,,,Without giving everything away,, I'll say a lil of what I thought was great about the moive -THE SETTING - the atmosphere is very dystopian like.TERMINATORS - I liked the fact that we see lots of Terminators (several different kinds) and there's no guessing what they are. Close to the end, we do see the T-800 in Arnold covering,, but until then the Terminators are all metal.The Resistance - John Connor is part of the Resistance,, but he's not in charge of it all. He has a command of a unit of troops,, and when he's not out fighting he reviews tapes his mother made for him.***Like I've said***,, this movie is what I wanted to see. I wish they had made at least 1 more following this one (of course,, 2 would've been preferable) with Bale as Connor. I think McG did a great job,,, too bad others didn't.If you're going to watch this one,, I suggest you watch Terminators 1, 2, and 3 before this. I think Terminator Salvation follows those 3 perfectly. Do not bother viewing Genisys or Dark Fate at the same time (not that they are bad,, they just don't belong with these other movies,,, at least not in the order I just said. If you're going to watch Dark Fate,, then view T1, T2,, then Dark Fate).Anyways,,, give this movie a chance,,, it really has gotten a bum rap.",True
25463,6 July 2020,zigmenthotep,Doctor Bloodbath (1987 Video),1.0,"Doctor Bloodbath, or Butcher Knife, is a um... movie, more or less, about a doctor who murders woman he's performed abortions on. Why is he doing that? No idea, there is basically no motivation provided for his actions, nor any insight into how it all started. As a viewer you're just dumped in the middle of a series of repetitive murders with no real beginning or meaningful conclusion.
Every aspect of this movie is just bad, writing, acting, cinematography, editing, lighting, sound design, and really, I'm being generous here by suggesting that there was intentional lighting or sound design involved. Honestly, if you told me that they shot and edited this entire thing in a weekend with no script, not only would I believe you, but it would make the existence of this thing a lot easier to comprehend.Doctor Bloodbath is one of the few movies I've seen that makes me question if it should even be considered a movie. It's more like about an hour of moving pictures and sometimes sound which vaguely resembles a narrative, something that seems enough like a movie that a few unfortunate souls may be tricked into handing over actual money for it.
And while I will accept a bad movie, I will not tolerate a deceptive one, and that's what this is, it literally uses the opening credits from another movie to make it look like it had a cast and crew that it did not. (Which I guess might be a good thing for the actors who were actually in it) Also fully ***like half of the film is padding, like changes in location are often accompanied by painful long driving and walking scenes, and just lots of other necessarily long shots that add absolutely nothing to the film other than run time, and several of aforementioned*** unnecessary padding scenes are actually the same footage used multiple times.
However, the weirdest, and most notable thing is the repeated use of clips from other movies, and I don't mean something like a stock footage establishing shot, they literally cut to shots from Nick Millard's earlier films in the middle of scenes, sometimes the characters actually talk with the characters from the reused clips. It's like something out of a late-night talk show sketch, but not intentionally a joke.",True

26291,26 February 2020,nick-graziano,Sin Palabras (2012),1.0,"This movie was somewhat entertaining, but the story line seems like it was written by some guy who is recently got dumped, and is day dreaming of a way out.The climax of the movie is the main character, Raúl, literally paying money to sell her into sex trafficking. I know some people might say that ""Raúl didn't know if they were good or bad people, but he was trying to do the right thing."" - that is a pretty flaccid counter, honestly. He went back, after realizing the mistake he made, and was banging on the door for several minutes. If they were good people, she could have easily walked out of the house. They forced her to stay in the house, because they were going to sell her into sex slavery. It is at this moment that Raúl should have called the police. Being detained in a foreign country because you lack a proper visa is much better than being a sex slave, trust me.Also, not to mention, this whole movie is about how he wasn't able to let go of the girl that dumped him, probably because he is too nice and not very bright. The guy didn't even have sheets on his bed, what a bum, no wonder she dumped him. She wanted to get away from him so fast that she left her belongings at his house and then travelled 5851 miles.The ""turning point"" of the movie is when he feels so much remorse for what he did that he finally cleans up his ex girlfriend's belongings and gives them to her mother. Great work. This movie goes to show you that if you are very dumb, you might accidentally pay money to put somebody into sex slavery.In the end, she finally ""escapes"" (literally just gets out of the car at a stop and runs away, really intricate stuff here) and then somehow is able to find Raúl's work in a city that she is unfamiliar with and doesn't speak the language... even though they had to take a bus to get to the place she was dropped off. It seems ***like they wrote*** a beautiful story (which it starts out as, I must admit) and then forgot that a good story has an ending.Meanwhile, Raúl quits his job so that he can go sit on the bench where he first met Liam and mope about the fact that he inadvertently paid money to give someone into sex slavery. What kind of logic is that? What was he planning on doing? Does this man not have any friends that he can talk to, who could possibly talk some sense into him? What about his family? Do they know this inept man is out there, almost ruining people's lives? Surely Mrs. Azucena tried to talk some sense into him. Or perhaps she let him go, realizing how dangerous someone with that level of stupidity is, especially in a hardware store.Anyways, she finally finds his shop, realizes he was not working there any longer, and the movie ends with them catching eyes and walking towards each other. Who writes this stuff? Why would the writer think that Liam would forgive this man, instead of fearing his idiocy? The movie is really only concerned with poor Raúl's feelings, shame.",True

Because it was highly entertaining action movie, that's why. ***Like I said*** many things didn't made enough sense, but that's not important when it has so many great action sequences (most of them were in the second half of the movie).

27055,9 December 2008,Mightyzebra,The Wise Quacking Duck (1943),8.0,"This Daffy Duck episode stars the crazy (and luckily not very greedy) Daffy and a weedy, pathetic (pathetic at first and then a bit less later) man who is trying to hunt him, because his wife forced him to (luckily she does not appear in any part of the episode). The hunter is searching for a duck and he quickly comes across Daffy eating seeds. Daffy is not to be easily killed however...I enjoyed this episode because Daffy, who is very unconventional and off-the-wall here (entertainingly so), is so good and because of the animation, the plot-line and the man who tries to hunt Daffy. The humour is also very good, fun and wacky. It is a bit odd for Looney Tunes humour, but will appeal to a great deal of viewers. A good deal of the jokes are old fashioned as well (***like the kissing one, which I like for some reason, which ccthemovieman pointed out***), stuff that would not be made today, for anyone's viewing, which is another highlight to the cartoon.I recommend this to people who enjoy old Looney Tunes and to people who like Daffy Duck, especially when he's CRAZY.

27057,9 December 2008,Kakueke,The Alamo (1960),8.0,"Many people, like myself, are interested in accuracy in historical dramas, and this leads to much debate in evaluating films done in the ""epic"" fashion. Should the protagonists be portrayed as heroes, villains, idealists, pragmatists, bumblers, egomaniacs? There is often room for interpretation. May I bring out The Alamo Director John Wayne himself in ""The Green Berets,"" set in Vietnam? Were Americans more ***like the idealistic, well-spoken, and noble heroes in Vietnam as Wayne portrays, or were they drug-infested people who called the enemies ""gooks""? The truth, as Oscar Wilde said***, ""is somewhere in between.""In the siege of The Alamo, however, the defining essentials are clear. I do not care whether Jim Bowie was in many ways a louse in his life before dying at the Alamo. What is relevant is his role at the Alamo. Was Davy Crockett actually captured before being killed? Again, I do not care (besides, the weight of evidence is that he was not captured).The fact is that these two and Alamo commander Colonel William Barret Travis, along with the others who died at the Alamo, were patriots concerned with freedom for Texas. They were willing to sacrifice their own lives, knowing that they would likely be killed by a much larger force, for an ideal. I do not see any way to say anything else. Davy Crockett is idealized in American folklore, but John Wayne as Davy confesses to a Spanish lady companion that he has not always been idealistic. Yet he is finding idealism in Texas, in events leading up to the siege. Colonel Travis (Lawrence Harvey) can be seen as nothing other than idealistic, history bears that out. Here, his accent seems like a combination of British (Harvey), New Orleans like in the movie ""JFK,"" and Southern, but it is clearly an educated person's aristocratic drawl, like Travis in real life almost surely had. He is well dressed and groomed, a formal military man. And what the hey, Bowie (Richard Widmark) is here statuesque, like Harvey, clean-shaven, and blond, in comparison to Bowie's real-life dark-haired ruffian looks. Wayne as director draws out well the clash of egos between Travis and Bowie, and Bowie's drinking and partying excesses. But when the chips are down, when Travis draws the line to tell people they can leave if they want, Bowie stays. Has to be accurate, correct?The cinematography is very well done: the organization and colored uniforms of the Mexican soldiers, the different areas and angles of the Alamo itself, the battlefield surrounding. The musical scores, the majestic background singing, are melodramatic and effective. There is little in terms of excess in scenes despite the film's length. Perhaps something could have been added to portray the point of view of Santa Anna and the Mexicans, but that is not done here; Santa Anna has virtually no time on the screen. The intent of Wayne was to portray the Texas point of view.The Alamo is one of John Wayne's finest moments.",True
27185,9 December 2008,Troopie,Much Ado About Nothing (1984 TV Movie),9.0,"This remains, for me, one of the best of this superb BBC series & certainly the best version of this particular play. This production saw no need to dress up the actors in ridiculous fake-military costumes (a vice Branagh shows off in all his productions, I know not why) or cut those parts which it didn't ***like (either do Shakespeare as he wrote*** it or write your own play!). Robert Lindsay reveals previously unsuspected Shakespearian talent & I would dearly love to see him take on some other such roles. He is superb in this, using his comic ability to bring out the humorous essence of Benedick & the beautiful Cherie Lunghi (who has never shown me a poor performance, be it in Shakespeare, Hornblower or even ""A Touch of Frost"") is a perfect partner, being both cuttingly witty & enticing -- enough to make any Benedick risk her barbs to chase her! Admittedly, Jon Finch isn't as good as Denzil Washington, who also showed untapped Shakespearian talent (a future Othello or even Iargo, maybe?) but he isn't actually bad. All in all, a joy to watch & a great introduction to Shakespeare's lighter works. Sincerely recommended.",True
27269,9 December 2008,richrodi,Voices of a Distant Star (2002),9.0,"Honestly this film is an inspiration to all budding film makers, graphic design artists, and artists a***like because the creator of this animated film, wrote***, directed, animated, and even voice acted everything in this film. His artwork and computer animation is quite breathtaking especially in the landscapes and skies he paints. This film tells a science fiction/mech anime/love story in a matter of only twenty five minutes while other animes would take over fifty episodes to properly express the relationships between the main characters and the political climates they are submerged in. Because of these elements this film truly surpasses the negative expectations a Japanese animated film might have attached to it. Voices of a Distant Star creates an extraordinary scenario in which the the main character's gender roles are switched. The quiet meek girl joins the air force and is sent off to die valiantly in war while the young man stays home and patiently waits for her phone calls. However these phone calls are delayed due to the fact they are light years apart. The main theme throughout this film is the communication between these two individuals. Even when they are unable to communicate their feelings and thoughts they remain close and eagerly await each other's phone call . Even with the vastness of space and time these two individuals manage to express themselves in a way that can not be contained in this universe. This theme, which simply yet stylistically laid out before us makes this film a truly remarkable and undeniably heartfelt melancholic tale.",True
27288,10 December 2008,Milo-Jeeder,Suspiria (1977),10.0,"There seems to be a never-ending feud between many horror fans regarding 'Suspiria', due to the fact that this film is considered Dario Argento's outstanding masterpiece. Personally, I'm completely against the idea of praising something that you don't actually like, so I respect anyone who thinks that this movie is overrated or even plain awful. My summary is only an opinion, but by no means I intend to make people change their mind or disapprove their concept of this film.'Suspiria' is one of the many Italian horror films that came out during the late 70s and early 80s, that is extremely criticized for having a supposedly questionable plot and denouement. If we compare this movie to some of the other popular films directed by Dario Argento, we're probably going to think that 'Suspiria', is perhaps not as intriguing or well developed, when it comes to the story. To give a few examples of some of the Argento films that are widely considered the actual masterpieces because they offer an intriguing plot, good imagery and well done endings, I would probably name 'The Bird with the Crystal Plumage', 'Deep Red' and 'The Cat o' Nine Tails'. So what is it that we should believe? Nothing! Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and even though I agree with those who claim that 'Suspiria' is Argento's real masterpiece, I would never waste my time trying to convince people that this is true. As a matter of fact, I'll be honest and say that I also believe that 'Suspiria' has a somehow underdeveloped story, but I still regard it as one of the best horror movies in history. The reason is simple: in my opinion, you can make something wonderful, without a wonderful plot. This is perhaps one of the most visually enchanting horror movies I have seen so far and I honestly doubt I will ever find another film that can enchant me as much as this one. Everything about 'Suspiria' is beautiful, even the violent deaths. I know this may sound sick and disgusting, but I believe Mr. Argento has the special gift to make beautiful images out of gruesome situations, like murder, for example. From the beginning until the end, this film takes us to a dark dreamland with beautiful contrasting colors, eerie locations and a recurrent unsettling music. The locations are perfect. The ballet school in which the story takes place, seems to be a nonexistent place taken from someone's dream. Indeed, it was revealed once that 'Suspiria' was partly inspired by a dream that Daria Nicolodi once had (Mrs. Nicolodi was the co-writer and Argento's girlfriend at the time). So if the idea was to create a dream-like movie, I would say they did a perfect job. Everything about 'Suspiria' looks surreal and charming. It's a dark fairy tale, in which the characters behave in a childish way, like playing along with the scenario. It is also said that the actresses were initially supposed to be little girls, but fearing that the film could be banned, Argento had to choose older actresses, but he didn't really change much of the dialogs, which I think is genius. Strangely, the characters don't come off as moronic or anything, they simply are strange and childish, but in a good way. The subject of sex, for example, is barely even mentioned, which is something that doesn't happen too often in horror movies with twenty-something year old characters. But regarding the actors who played these characters, I would mostly compliment the work of the late actresses Joan Bennett and Alida Valli. The young cast was simply fine, but no one did a remarkable job. Not even Jessica Harper, who was a bad choice for the lead character, in my opinion. This is probably the only little detail I would criticize about this film. Mrs. Harper pretty much has the same facial expression and tone of voice throughout the entire film, which is not good. On the other hand, ***like I said*** before, Mrs. Valli and Mrs. Bennett were flawless as the two bitter old women who run the school with their awful temper and their little psychological tortures against those who stand in their ways. So concluding: 'Suspiria' is one of those films that you either love or hate. Both feelings are equally respectable and I can understand why some people don't really appreciate it. But if I have to recommend or 'sell' this movie to someone, I would definitely highlight the dream-like imagery and the creepy music composed by The Goblins, that go perfectly well with what is seen on the screen. Enjoy this dark fairy tale about witches and childish girls.",True

27435,10 December 2008,cantstopsnoring,Conjurer (2008),8.0,"I read this was screening at this year's Slamdance festival in the Twilight Section. Slamdance only chooses films with under a million dollar budget from first time filmmakers so it caught my eye. Then I checked out the film's website and saw it had won four other film festival awards and had good reviews so I rented it to see what this little half million dollar film had going for it. I like watching indie films and this looked at least interesting.First, for such a low budget it's far better than a lot of studio movies with 20, 30 or 40 times the budget. Second, it's also almost old-fashioned in the slow pace and lack of gore for a horror flick so I can see why viewers that like jump-cut gore are going to find it too tame. But ***like other reviewers have said***, when it seems that all we ever get lately is films going the slasher and blood route and the herky-jerky Asian horror plus ridiculous CGI FX that have become almost laughable, this director bucked the trend and went more cerebral and eerie. This had to be a conscious decision on the part of the producers since it's clear they had solid creative elements involved in the photography, FX and make-up departments that were used sparingly. I'm pretty sure that certain elements of the story could have have been stronger and shot better if they had more time and money and locations, but it was overall quite effective. It never felt low budget especially only a half million dollars. Oh and I should mention that John Schneider was also actually very good in this, small part but used well. Conjurer gets an 8 for doing a lot for a little.",True

27552,10 December 2008,RaspberryWaffles,Bicentennial Man (1999),8.0,"This movie is fantastic, sheer brilliance, in my opinion the most beautiful love story ever told, while not being anywhere near a classic love story. The first hour of the movie is pure old fashioned fun, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Yet when you enter the last half of the film, it takes a dramatic turn for the better. A lot of people bashed this film, and even though for the most part it was a box office flop, I believe it to be one of the best romance films I've ever seen.This was the role that Williams was born to play. Before this he was mostly cast in overly clichéd comedies with flawed scripts. He was known for being one of the funniest men in the industry, but he really shows his true colors in this film. While being generally comedic he makes sure that he keeps his character light-hearted and optimistic. He is a robot who wishes to be human, and will never rest until his goal is completed. The defining moments of the movie are not in its comedy, but in its drama and the social conflict Andrew (Williams) faces with trying to change. The final scene of this movie will have tears flowing and the tissues flying. Every time I watch this film, the ending always gets me, its more powerful than Titanic or King Kong, Capote or Gone With The Wind.Supporting Williams in this brilliant film are ""Sir"" Richard Martin (Sam Neil), his caring master and provider. Sam Neil notices the extraordinary originality and difference in Andrew from other robots and uses this to teach Andrew of the ways of man. A career high for Sam Neil, he portrays a character both enlightened and later distraught by Andrew. Little Miss Amanda Martin (Embeth Davidtz) is the daughter of ""Sir"" Martin who soon befriends and becomes very attached to Andrew. Andrew and Little Miss form a bond that is lovable and innocent. Embeth Davidtz later portrays Portia Charney, the grand-daughter of Little Miss, whom Williams has a hard time dealing with. Oliver Platt performs as Rupert Burns, an intelligent yet underestimated engineer of robots who helps Andrew on his journey to change. His comedic excellence truly lifts this movie and ***like I said*** before, makes sure it doesn't take itself too seriously. The other performances in this film support it greatly, whether it is comedic and dramatic.Altogether, I find this to be one fantastic film. I cannot understand now how this movie was so overlooked and bashed by the public and critics alike. I found it to be a gem and one truly heartbreaking yet uplifting movie that brings hope in believing that this world can make the right decisions. Yet it also brings very sad feelings knowing that it can take so long to be acknowledged for what and who one is. The ending of this movie will leave you breathless and simply taken aback. Trust me, forget all of the things you've heard about this film and give it another shot with an open mind and an open heart. This movie deserves to be noticed among some of the greats, as it is a beautiful portrait of life outside human existence, and how one man can change the way the entire world views one thing. I hope this review was helpful, and ""In the words of the great Andrew Martin, one is glad to be of service.""",True
27632,10 December 2008,Goodbye_Ruby_Tuesday,Bigger Than Life (1956),10.0,"When the 1999 Best Picture winner American BEAUTY came out, its marketing campaign stressed for the audience to ""look closer"" at the typical American family; while I still enjoy Sam Mendes' debut film, I wish people had taken the film's famous tagline more to heart and sought out this obscure gem of a film, because it's both a time capsule of its time and it's one of the most ageless films of all time. James Mason delivers possibly his greatest performance under Nicholas Ray's trusted, fatherly direction (the master auteur also worked wonders exposing the surprising depth of Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame in IN A LONELY PLACE (1950), Cyd Charisse and Robert Taylor in PARTY GIRL (1958), Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell in THEY LIVE BY NIGHT (1948) and of course the trio in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE) as a man going insane from 1950s repression. It's one of the greatest American films ever made that few Americans have actually seen (as of this writing it's not on Region-1 DVD), though Jean-Luc Godard, who named it one of the greatest American films of the 1950s and briefly referenced it in his film CONTEMPT (1963), and Martin Scorsese, who has written of its power and included clips in his great documentary A PERSONAL JOURNEY THROUGH American MOVIES WITH MARTIN SCORSESE (1995), are big fans of this film.Nicholas Ray's CinemaScope masterpiece was criticized and neglected upon its initial release after his smash hit REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (1955). What did they expect from a filmmaker whose titles of films, especially his previous one, defined his existence? BIGGER THAN LIFE is his subtle, scathing attack on the suffocating 1950s conformity and the empty promise of the American Dream--to the hip indie crowd, this is the 50s answer to HALF NELSON (2005). Like his Humbert Humbert of LOLITA (1962), Mason plays a British intellect who falls from grace in America. On the surface this film is an attack on Cortisone (and to the publicity department at 20th Century Fox, this film refused to place blame on the doctors, instead making the whole film look ***like Mason's fault with such captions of a doctor saying ""I prescribed it--HE misused it!""), but what came first, the drug or the social claustrophobia? The Cortisone didn't create Ed Avery's psychosis, it only highlighted it, and it certainly won't cure it (Ray once wryly said*** that the film ""is about a miracle drug. I don't believe in miracles""). Even as he eschews religion (""GOD WAS WRONG!"") and the school system (""We're breeding a race of moral midgets!"") during his bouts of heightened egomania, some balancing on horrifyingly awful and terrifyingly true, he's never free from his repression, which makes the film's seemingly Hallmark Happy Ending all the more disturbing.It's a masterpiece of repression, innocence lost, and, more simply, amazing film-making. I cannot stress how badly this film begs to be seen and rediscovered by a newer audience, not unlike how Hitchcock's VERTIGO received the respect it deserved after its initial lukewarm reception. God was wrong. Nicholas Ray was right.",True
27911,11 December 2008,bensonmum2,Future War (1997 Video),1.0,"I've just about reached my limit. I've watched more than my share of bad movies in the past few months. Sure, as is the case with Future War, I've watched many of these movies courtesy of and with the assistance of Mystery Science Theater 3000 - but I've watched them just the same. Future War may be the last for a while. It's so bad I'm ready to swear off bad movies all together.The plot is a completely ridiculous mish-mash of incomprehensible ideas that never made a lick of sense to me. Something about a traveler from the future with cyborgs and their dinosaur ""trackers"" hot on his heels. The only person he's got to turn to for help is a former druggy/prostitute turned nun facing a crisis of faith. ***Like I said***, none of it makes sense.I've said this so many times that I'm starting to sound like a broken record, but Future War is bad in every way a movie can be bad. The acting is beyond pitiful. Neither of the movies' two leads, Daniel Bernhardt or Travis Brooke Stewart, seem capable of acting their way onto a community theater stage, let alone a sound-stage. Most surprising to me is that Bernhardt went on to have a fairly successful career, because in Future War, he comes across as nothing more than a Jean-Claude Van Damme wannabe without any of Van Damme's talent. (Did I just insinuate that Van Damme has talent?) Beyond the acting, the special effects are of particular note. The dinosaurs are about the most Gawd awful things I've seen in a movie. I could film something about as realistic with the plastic dinosaurs my son has in his room. Wait a minute - I think that might be what they used! Finally (and believe me, I could go on forever), the editing in Future War is atrocious. Some scenes are edited so poorly that it's all but impossible to follow the action.Overall, Future War is about as bad as a movie can get. I can't really come up with an inspired description, so I'll end this by saying, ""It sux!""",True

During her funeral, two men torch the county records office in order to destroy her files. Jonathan Stambler contacts Charlie Townsend and ask for his help locating Joan's son, Bill. Joan had suddenly broken off their engagement 35 years earlier, and Stambler suspects that she had been pregnant with his child. The Angels go to Caines Corners to investigate, and are confronted by a man on Joan's property. He is shot to death moments later, and the Angels are able to identify him as an employee of Brockhurst Industries, a corporation with syndicate ties. Sabrina flies to New York to meet with George Faylon, CEO of Brockhurst Industries. She learns that Joan was the daughter of the company founder, but cut all ties to her father because she objected to his lifestyle. Sabrina theorizes that Faylon didn't want the employee to find Bill because he is the potential heir to the company. One of the men who torched the records office follows Sabrina to New York and takes a shot at her. Kelly, Kris and Bosley fly to Reno to see Bill take part in an air show. Kelly meets lone wolf Bill and quickly develops a connection with him, but Stambler objects to her refusal to immediately tell Bill the purpose of her mission. The other man responsible for the fire hits on Kris in order to stay close to her and monitor the investigation. Evelyn Wales, Stambler's nurse and personal assistant, is actually behind the fire and attempt on Sabrina's life. Fearing that she is about to lose her claim on Stambler's estate, she orders the men to kill Kelly, Kris and Bill. This is a rehashed plot from the second season's episode entitled Angel In Love.In it,we find Sabrina in love with somebody and somewhat acts unprofessionally towards her fellow private detectives.This time around,it is Kelly who is in love with Bill,an acrobatic pilot and she,too acts unprofessionally just ***like Sabrina in that said*** episode.Also,we also get to see the familiar theme wherein people want to prevent them from solving the case - the truth about the acrobatic pilot who happens to be an heir - and their lives are in danger again. Added to that,this will also be another plot that will be rehashed in the fourth season.Just find out what it is wherein this time around the Angels lives are in danger and both Kelly and Kris have fallen with the same man.LOL The only great thing about it is the fact that our Angels get to go to Reno this time around after going to Vegas in the first episode of the third season.",True
28185,30 August 2013,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones (2013),8.0,"When I saw the trailers, I became very amused and read all five Mortal Instruments books with a sixth book coming next year. Then, as I watched it, it turned out to be a very interesting film. Although, I do understand the critical reception it had due to it's similarities of Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, and Twilight, but I don't think it's as bad as they say it is because what these critics don't know is that ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" is entirely different than those films and much better than Twilight in my opinion (heck, even better than the ""Twilight-wannabe"" Beautiful Creatures).Before I can get to the good stuff, I would say that there are some flaws. The story is a lot more engaging than Twilight and Beautiful Creatures and the opening is well-done, but when it comes to young-adult film adaptations, it did left out some of the important stuff that have already caused an outrage to the fans, although they did give a lot of nice detail of the world created by Cassandra Clare. Also, the romance between Jace and Clary is poorly done because it transited some scenes a bit too fast and there wasn't enough chemistry.With that said, everything else was great. The visuals are breathtakingly beautiful, the scenery is nice to look at, and the special effects are very cool (even the creepy demons look realistic). The music score, aside from a few out of place pop songs, is epic with a lot of atmospheric stuff in it. There are bits of funny moments and the action sequences are entertaining, but the best part would have to go to a decent cast of actors.Lily Collins is very appealing as Clary and emotes very well with the supporting actors, Jamie Campbell as Jace is very witty, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers is very sinister as Valentine Morgenstern. The script is fine with really smart dialog and the direction from Harold Zwart is solid.Overall, TMI: COB isn't as excellent as the other fantasy films ***like ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and ""Harry Potter"", but like I said*** before, it's a lot better than Twilight and I strongly suggest that anyone, especially those who haven't read the books, can go check it out!

With Emily in hospital confinement and Dr. Banks' practice crumbling around him, the case seems closed. Dr. Banks cannot accept responsibility and investigates to clear his name....Soderbergh has supposedly retired, and after 24 years of movie making, he has covered almost every genre apart from horror, and with this movie, he touches on the sub genre of Erotic thrillers that were everywhere twenty years ago.If it were made back then, Sharon Stone or Demi Moore would have been the lead, and Michael Douglas would have been in it somewhere, and it would have been one of the biggest hits of the year.Films like Basic Instinct, Final Analysis, Disclosure, and Sliver spring to mind when watching this, and that's not a criticism of the film.My only advice for you is not to read anything about the film, I hadn't, and that's quite an achievement in this day and age, and I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome.Its ridiculous to say the least, and its almost as if Soderbergh is doing this, knowing is a completely bonkers film, and in other hands, it would have been pap, but with his great cast, and beautiful camera work, he's made a classy 'Erotic Thriller'.Law is brilliant as the troubled Doctor, and ***like I already said***, if you haven't read too much about, you wouldn't know that the main narrative is about Law, not about Emily, and he really is the glue to holding the arguably absurd plot together.You really have to suspend relief, a lot of the film is really eyebrow raising, but its fun, with some really good twists, and a satisfying ending.Well worth seeing.",True

A cheerleading episode is definitely a must for the writers during the show's run in the 70's considering a lot of professional team's popular cheerleaders back then.Despite the fact that the plot is somewhat ludicrous,the writers made it up for a villain that has a multiple personality disorder.A complex villain like that in the 70's made it somewhat original and refreshing when this particular episode was shown.Of course,just ***like what I have stated*** previously,the Kris Munroe Myth (Kris is always the Angel that is victimized - kidnapped,sexually aroused,imprisoned,drugged,etc) is still in effect since she was kidnapped in it.This made the episode entertaining and one of the better ones unlike most episodes in Season 5.",True
28271,31 August 2013,Coventry,Mammoth (2006 TV Movie),1.0,"In case you ever wondered why movies like ""Schindler's List"", ""Ghandi"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" are so unendurably horrible, it's because they're so grotesquely unrealistic and absurd! Truly brilliant movies are plausible and terrifyingly authentic  like ""Mammoth"", for example! This movie has – hands down and without a doubt – the most intelligent and convoluted screenplay ever written and it's a downright disgrace (blasphemy, even) that this landmark of cinema shamefully got overlooked during the Academy Awards Ceremony in 2007. Dig this: a meteor, carrying an alien parasite, crash-lands in a museum of national history and invades the frozen remains of a 600.000 year-old mammoth. The humongous prehistoric elephant promptly awakens and goes for a walk in the nearby woods, disturbing an illegal teenage party, a senior citizen's sex excursion and the already disturbed family life of museum curator Frank Abernathy. He goes after the mammoth, along with his sweet sixteen daughter and her horny boyfriend, a CIA agent with beautiful big boobies, a retarded redneck sheriff and his own B-movie obsessed father (oh Tom Skerritt, whatever happened to your career?). ***Like I said*** already, sheer genius filmmaking, complete with profound dialogs, brilliant plot twists and some of the most advanced hi-tech computer engineered special effects ever beheld with human eyes. The alien invader is some kind of body snatcher and literally sucks the life out of his victims' corpses through the mammoth's trunk. Phenomenal performances all around, particularly from the gorgeous Summer Glau, who's in fact a 25-years old but effortlessly depicts a troublesome teenager. In short, this is the type of motion picture Thomas Edison, the Lumière Brothers and Georges Méliès envisioned when they invented and developed the medium of cinema!

28301,31 August 2013,secondtake,The Promoter (1952),8.0,"The Card (1952)This is an Alec Guinness movie top to bottom, which is probably misleading to people who don't know his best films like ""The Man in the White Suit"" the year before or ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" or ""The Lavender Hill Mob."" This one is not a comic classic ***like those, but it is in fact in the same lineage (never mind that American detective master Eric Ambler wrote*** the screenplay).For those familiar with British comic dramas like these, you'll know what to expect, and ""The Card"" is really filled with warmth, wry humor, absurdist twists, and lots of changes of course. If you don't know of this Guinness (et al) background you'll maybe recognize this as a precursor to the humor of Peter Sellers and (by extension in his films) Woody Allen (of all people). But another side to this makeshift analysis is the American screwball comedy of the 1930s and early 40s. In a way, that's where this has its roots. A unlikely love is bound to happen between the leading man and leading woman, but things continually get in the way. Until the end.It's not a screwball however. It never gets quite that zany, or in fact quite that ""good,"" if you happen to like the great screwballs. It's not that ""The Card"" is restrained, exactly, but it has an almost serious tone at moments, and the whole backdrop (of a man moving up through the ranks of a working class culture) is something of a normal course for heroes in regular dramas.The name of the movie on its release is the best, because a card is someone who has some tricks up his sleeve, or who is wily at other people's expense (though light heartedly, for sure). The American release changed the name (for no good reason, I think) to ""The Promotor,"" which implies either an impresario (perhaps a bit tongue in cheek) or someone who is playing the system for his own gain. And that's not really what Guinness's character is quite all about.One of the odd things about Guinness is his particular style, which you might say is all his own. And which makes the movie its own. He's comic with always this softening of the edges. He smiles and is likable but never quite with genuine warmth. You might even suspect of him of being too much an actor, so that every emotion is a trained one. That works better in some of his other movies, where the director plays against that type. Here he is made to be a bit more of a standard leading man, and it falters just a hair.You might also find the plot is not especially compelling. You won't really care what happens, partly because you already half know, and partly because the succession of events it sufficient enough, not for the end result but for the moments, each one. Still, there's nothing quite like this in American film, certainly not by 1952 (that I know of), so if you like this you might really be transported. Very well made, oddly sincere, and if not belly-laugh stuff, still warm and happy.",True

Here Dr. Vincent van Gore gets more hysteric on his voice, and Mr. Tjersland still ridicule the events on every single videos shown here. And they're still lying about the events taking place in Japan, when they are clearly from other Asian countries like Thailand.In one scene we even get so see one recipe for a dish which involve human flesh. However, I just overlooked it and focused on the scene itself.And just thinking about some of the crushed heads in the traffic accident videos makes me gross...Absolute NO joking here.To make it worse, sound effects are clearly heard often; Blood dripping whenever blood is shown, a Howie Scream is clearly heard in one sequence, and some laughing-children-sound almost made me think ""Diddy Kong Racing"". SHAME ON YOU, ""MOVIE TEAM""!!!I'm very sorry if I overreacted here about the sound effects, but this was how I felt when watching this film. But ***like I said*** in my review for the film's predecessor, there is nothing to see in this so-called 'movie'. But if you like 100% real gore and really want to see this, please DON'T watch it for the sake of entertainment, as there are nothing entertaining with this video.

The ways it deals with issues like mother/son relationships are miraculous in the way that even though the plot makes it an extreme example, the feelings of Ryan Gosling and KST just hit so hard that it can give insight and thought to most everyone. People have been only praising this film for it's cinematography/atmosphere and music but the truth is that those things are there and work so well only because of Ryan Gosling and KST, their emotions extend through these mediums because of the skill of the actors and the DP/Composer. The unity of the film is un***like anything before, and the film's questions are so strong that I don't see why people are trying to pin down a statement because it seems to me that the way a film affects someone's thinking is stronger than any statement explicitly stated*** since the expression comes through the viewer and can be ever more personal because of it. This is my most favorite film of Refn's now, with Bronson coming in second and strangely enough, I didn't like Drive that much even though I thought it was a great movie.

Seriously, you can tell they're fake! And you wanna know what's worse? Thanks to them, this stupid thing now has a SIX POINT ONE RATING! No really! Just yesterday (last night) I checked and it was 5.9 and already it went up by .2 in less than 24 hours! And a few days before yesterday it was actually at 5.5 and before that 5.1! And as of 19 days ago (August 12 when the last comment was written), it was 4.9! As that person mentioned it was actually at 1.7 before the recent rave reviews and ratings started on June 14-24. And even WITHOUT the REVIEWS, it STILL keeps going up! As if it wasn't pathetic enough already when the rave reviews were coming from users who'd NEVER written a review, had just registered, and STILL haven't written any other reviews since, now it's gotten to where they just register, rate it 10, and do nothing else! Hence now we can't even tell who were the voters, what were their user names, what else they've rated, or if they even saw it. And even if they did, it's clearly the same person OVER and OVER and OVER again. And who else could it possibly be besides someone who was involved in it in SOME way? Unless they have a huge fantard following perhaps, but I highly doubt that! The only morons that could like something this stupid are either toddlers (dumb toddlers, who've never seen a single quality movie in their lives), or someone whose mental ability is that of a dumb toddler.Bottom line, this is getting WAY overrated. Someone should do something! How this stupid piece of alien excrement that's an OBVIOUS mockbuster of Teletubbies (a great show btw) got a 6.1 while Gordy (a masterpiece of family film-making that's as adorable as the titular talking piglet it's about) got only 3.4 and the Teletubbies got 2.9 is something I will NEVER understand. And guess what else? They have another children's ""show"" out now called Rabbids Invasion which also rips off Teletubbies! And guess what rating IT got? A 5.8! Yet the REAL DEAL, Teletubbies, got 2.9! Seriously people, STOP supporting this ALIEN ABOMINATION and start supporting Gordy and Teletubbies! Don't support this ""movie"" or the Rabbids Invasion ""show"" which is just as bad!EDIT ON September 2: Now it's up to six point THREE, AND yet another bogus review showed up! Seriously! This should not be allowed! I think all the 10/10 ratings and reviews HAVE to be coming from SOMEONE involved with this thing. This stinky, smelly, STUPID piece of alien excrement. HOW can it get 6.3, yet Gordy STILL only has 3.4! I DO NOT GET THAT! AND I NEVER WILL! Gordy is a quality family film. A film that shows no matter how small you may be, you can always make a difference! That family and friendship are among the most powerful forces of the Earth! What is The Oogieloves supposed to teach? That no matter how terrible, horrible, awful, and STUPID of an idea you may have for a film, it can not only be made, but get released THEATRICALLY? And in over 2,000 theaters at that. And how much money did it make? It got released in over 2,000 theaters and what, TWO people per showing showed up? That alone tells you how bad it is. Even little kids are going to look at it and think, ""Is this supposed to be for us? Do they really think we're that dumb?"" I mean, I remember some 10+ years ago, after Cinderella II came out on video (unlike Oogieloves it was CORRECTLY released, i.e. DIRECT to video), about a year later they played it on TV, and I'd never bought it (thankfully), so when it aired on TV I thought hey, let's see if it any good. I was about 8 years old then, and even THEN I thought it was dumb! I was like, ""THAT'S the long-awaited sequel to Cinderella?"" So yes, parents, even kids know when they've seen a movie that was not good. So don't even TRY to expose your children to such UTTER rubbish AND poppycock as The Oogieloves. I also cannot believe this has not yet been reviewed by anthony-rigoni, whose most recent review is for Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale. Most of the statements he made in that review can obviously be said about this as well, especially the first and very last parts of the second paragraph. ***Like anthony-rigoni said*** (about Spider's Web but I believe it applies to this and the Rabbids just as much) stay far, far, far away from this cinematic brain tumor that no child should be forced to watch against their will. Don't even try to use it as a cheap baby-sitter. You can use ANY great Disney animated classic for that.EDIT AGAIN ON September 6: Yet ANOTHER bogus review! The jig is up already man! We know it's all one person! Just shut up already! AND the rating is now 6.5. I wish it would go back to being rated a 1.8 like it was originally, because then it'd be rated lower than ANYTHING in the Bottom 100! That means this SHOULD be in the Bottom 100! At #1! The ONLY place this stupid thing would EVER get any legit recognition (besides the Razzies, and for some reason it did not win any of those, even though it should have won them ALL!)EDIT ON September 10: THANK YOU dwnetseeker!

29674,2 September 2020,Horst_In_Translation,Das Haus ihres Vaters (2010 TV Movie),2.0,"""Das Haus ihres Vaters"", which means ""Her father's house"", is a German television film from 2010, so this one has its 10th anniversary this year. Initially, they planned to go with the title ""Das Haus meines Vaters"", which means ""My father's house"", but for that the girl was probably not protagonist enough. Anyway, this film is based on a book by a writer who died 20 years before this movie was made. I have not read said book, so I cannot talk about parallels and differences between the base material and the movie, but I genuinely hope that the book was better than the adaptation here. Maybe it is a good thing the writer did not have to see the travesty they turned this into. I will spare you the names of the two screenplay writers because they really do not deserve to be named. There is no quality in the screenplay sadly. But the director shall be named. Matthias Tiefenbacher was the man in charge behind the camera here, fairly experienced filmmaker, but just like with his two writers, his body of work is considerably more about quantity than quality and this film here is probably not even his worst achievement, even if it is pretty bad already. As for the cast, Sarnau is easy to identify although I personally keep mixing her up a bit with Sonsee Neu, but my felllow German film buffs will recognize the face for sure. Same applies to Hans-Jochen Wagner, an actor with a face that is pretty easy to recognize, but maybe not too many will remember his name. Same is true for Saskia Vester who always reminds me physically of Martha Plympton, even if she is certainly not a talented actress. Vester I mean. Nonetheless, she was better here than in other films, maybe because she is ""only"" a big supporting player. Lisa Kreuzer is in it too, but only briefly. Early on, she has one longer scene and another brief inclusion at the end. Sturm I personally did not recognize and Hollinderbäumer from the abysmal ""heute show"" has basically one scene only. So we do have an experienced cast here, one that is better than what you usually get for German small screen releases and I personally felt the cast was the smallest problem this 1.5-hour movie had. Admittedly, they weren't good either, but there are many other weaker aspects, most of all the script obviously. Oh, I forgot one actress, namely the young Janina Stopper, who is pretty much a co-lead. She was surprisingly good and it makes me a bit sad to see that later on, she was mostly on stuff like ""Aktenzeichen XY"". I ee some talent in her, nut just good looks. I hope she can have a better career and things go north for her again.***Like I said*** in the title of my review, I kind awanted to like this. The idea of a mother wanting to get in touch with her now almost grown-up daughter is interetsing enough to result in a decent film with solid execution. Sadly, this is not what we get here. It wwas never half as emotional as it could have been. Always bleak and stale. A lot of it has to do with Sarnau's performance. I don't think she was up for the challenge to carry this movie mostly on her shoulders, which would have been her task playing the central character. I saw three face expressions max from her here and that makes one every half hour. Not fulfilling at all. Nonetheless it must be said that probably not even the most talented actress on the planet could have turned this into a quality watch. the writing is just too poor. Honestly, I had moments when, mostly thanks to the female child actress, I considered giving this two stars out of five and not two stars out of ten, but then reality hit and there is just no way for me to say this is a weak film. It is a terrible film. ARD once again delivering nothing but crap. One thing you very frequently find in these films are anti-male messages, simply because the films are for women mostly. Let's take a look at the men in this film. The biological father? Dead. Her husband? Has to deal with his wife not saying a thing that she has a daughter for almost 20 years and even now she does not respond when being asked. Of course, she has to mean the world for him and he will still stay with her 100%. JJust like every male should behave in this scenario. The adopted father? More of a muppet. Also has to love his wife dearly and yet is not taken seriously. When mother and daughter are in Italy and Sarnau's character calls, she gets him on the phone, but immeediately wants to talk to vester's character instead. He also has to stay behind, despite offering to drive with her. Okay. And very early on, we have some scenes from the court the female protagonist is working at. One husband there is boastful and loud and insulting. The next we hear nothing from, but see that he punched his wife violently in the face. Sweet. At the same time, all the female characters may have flaws too, but still they are depicted as likable and caring. Revolting really. Oh yeah, of course our heroine is also a top judge, youngest in her position, so really successful professional, successful enough for her big boss to show up and talk to her and say how she is his best ""employee"". Sigh. By the way, one male character/actor I did not mention yet is the boy. He was bad, also more because of the writing though. His statement early on about how he has lived in that house with this family for x years and knows when something is wrong felt so fake, like even daddy did not realize, but of course he was right. And when the boy knows eventually that the girl is his sister (well, half-sister), this was the final nail in the coffin when I had no doubt I have to give this film the lowest rating possible. On my scale, that is. I don't hand out 1s. It is also debatable how realistic the spontaneous trip to Italy may be at the end or how realistic the fact may be that the girl is on the other scale of the law initially, but I would have said one of these two things would have been enough. In general, this movie strugggles very hard with character development. Like early on, Sarnau's character and how she has not cared for her daugghter for 17 years and then breaks into tears in the bathroom and won't let go when it comes to finding her and staying in touch, only to tell Vester's character near the end that she is ready to do so. made no sense. Vester's character the same: She tells the biological mother to disappear from their lives, but 10 minutes later, she understands her motivation and is not so strict anymore. And finally, the daughter. She is so mad at her real mother and adopted mother on different occasions, but quickly i all calm and restrained again, even travelling out of nowhere to Italy with her biological mother. For hours in the same car with the woman she insulted very harshly five minutes earlier. Sigh. It is just not working out. This also applies to the forced happy ending again. The girl is once again (and rightfully) in rage mode and after being for herself in the nature briefly, she is all calm and restrained and lost all her angger and there is so much harmony between her and Vester's character, while Sarnau's is driving home on her own showing us how kind of a woman she is and that she would never take away her daughter from the woman who took care of said daughter in the last 17 years. It just does not feel authentic whatsoever. Nothing about this movie really, even the smaller moments like daddy being called to the hospital right on time for mother to read the letter from Italy. Just one of many exammples during which this film came extremely short quality-wise. Very disappointing. So yeah, the song during the closing credits was nice, but this is also the only positive thing I can say about the music here. The soundtrack is also rather on the pseudo important side. Fat thumbs-down for this film. Highly not recommended.",True
29756,2 September 2020,ivo_shandor,Justice League Dark: Apokolips War (2020 Video),1.0,"Can we rename Justice League Dark: Apokolips War to that? It's an awful mix of bizarre choices like those from Rise of Skywalker, mixed with a blatant attempt to recreate the grand epic scale one the best comic book movie ever. I don't care at all for the New 52 universe (I'm sure I'm not alone on that) and I've hated pretty much every single movie in the current DC animated universe. DC has been playing catch up for the last ten years of Marvel movies, trying to copy every movie that comes out with a carbon copy of their own. Cause and effect. With every big fish in the ocean, there's a leach on the bottom.
Coming off of the disaster of the Justice League movie, DC can't get their act together in time to make up for Endgame, so they turned to TV and animation in order to try to compensate. First Crisis on Infinite Earths and now this. Every movie in the animated universe feels like it was made in an assembly line at a plant by people who don't care, each one churned out without any quality control. It sits at an hour and a half length, the exact same studio mandated time frame for all of their movies on the assembly line. I remember back in the day when each animated movie would be given it's own individual attention, telling a specific story, with great writing and characters. They didn't follow a passionless sequel pattern; each one was unique and memorable. It's way too short to accomplish the scope of the story they wanted to tell. So much stuff happens so quickly that you're not supposed to think about it or given time to react.
DC just keeps proving that they don't understand their characters like Marvel does; they don't act like they should, both in personality and actions. Every single movie has too many problems to name. A big one is ignoring their own continuity or just being stupidly unaware of it. Inconsistent voice actors and characters, who disappear and reappear at the drop of a hat, plot points and character actions that dead end into brick walls, and undoing character arcs and motivations on a whim. It's funny how even the title is pointless; it's called Dark because the movie is dark, comically violent and vulgar in a childish attempt to show how mature and gritty DC can be. It's no sequel to the previous Dark entry, since continuity is thrown right out the window, so we're just left with DC flaunting how Dark they can be like a child banging pots in your ear for attention.
The biggest problem with the movie is that it ends with a literal reboot of the series. The creators basically realized that they screwed up their entire franchise from the start, said screw it, we'll just wipe the slate clean, instead of coming up with a satisfactory ending. Looks like taking the time and effort to writing a good story is too hard for DC. After hating the series from the start, you'd think it'd be worth celebrating erasing these movies from existence, which it is, but it left no hope for us or the franchise, and just showed an enormous lack of imagination and creativity for the future; basically it wasted our time for the last ten years. Should we really get emotionally invested in something, only for the rug to be pulled out from under us, with the magician saying, just kidding, it was all a hoax.
Much like the new Star Wars trilogy and Rise of Skywalker, this one showed they had absolutely no idea where they were going with the franchise. Not having a plan in the long run, that just forced them to change each direction with each movie, just going where the wind took them instead of taking control of the direction themselves. The same problem befell the live action DC movies, until they got the hint. Instead of having a deep villain, one with layers and a great motivation, ***like say Thanos, this one just said***, okay Darkseid is the bad guy and he's bad. He wants to do bad things, and his faceless army of monsters will do everything, while he just stands around accomplishing absolutely nothing on his own. It's ***like a child wrote*** the movie while playing his Superman toys, pretending there's lot of swearing, blood, gore and violence, cause that's what makes movies cool, before his parents catch him for being out of bed and yell at him.
I love the DC heroes lineup, but this movie didn't make me care about any of them, because the movie didn't even care for them, showing no respect or reverence for the history or place these characters hold in our hearts. Characters are picked off in like five minutes, no death is shown to have a bigger impact than another, and some get barely 3 lines of dialogue, if any. It's an absolute mess, it makes the live action Justice League look like a Renaissance panting. DC Animation went the way of the dodo, just like the Lucasfilm Star Wars animated division. We're constantly left questioning every single decision, action, and line of dialogue. Almost every joke fell flat, every dramatic moment an empty void. There was one joke that got a laugh, and one moment that felt like a genuine Superman moment, but as quickly as it came, it's gone just like that. The greatest trick that DC ever pulled, was convincing the world this series had hope and was going somewhere. And just like that.....it's gone.",True

But ***like so many other people who wrote*** comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul.

So for those reviews that call this documentary a ""propaganda"" fest, perhaps you've never watched a documentary before?Moving on.THE GOOD
This was an incredibly well produced and well shot documentary. Far better than most documentaries out there, and the cinematography was truly beautiful. For that alone I would have enjoyed it.In terms of message, WOW - All I can say is you should watch it and decide for yourself.I also love that this addresses plant based, high performance athletes (Not just skinny carrot munchers working a desk job) Well worth the watch!THE ""MEH""
There are a few things I wish they'd addressed or at least been a little less biased1) The movie goes on and on about the benefits of a plant based lifestyle (Which there are truly many) HOWEVER - They don't actually talk about the fact that it needs to be a whole foods / healthy plant based diet to see the benefit.AKA just because you're vegan won't make you healthy if you sit around on your lazy  and live off of potato chips and candy corn. Plant based? Yes. Healthy? Definitely not.2) I would have loved a little more facts and a little less sensationalism... This is a catch 22 because facts don't move people to action - Emotion does. Therefore for the documentary to present all the facts would have been great, BUT I also recognize that most people out there are more interested in being entertained than being educated... Just look at prime time TV.So while yes, its a documentary biased towards eating vegetables and giving up on meat... You can't argue with the fact that meat production is destroying our planet, that there are increasing numbers of studies showing animal products cause cancer and disease, and that factory farming of animals is certainly cruel and ethically questionable at the least.***Like I said*** earlier - Watch it for yourself, and make an informed decision.

31295,5 May 2020,aaarthika,Psycho (I) (2020),1.0,"This movie has a very unbelievable premise. Also a lot of ableism happening between the main two characters investigating the the killings. It was just entirely unbelievable and stupid. There were too many loopholes than one can even count. A few things: Why would Daagini push him off the stage in the start of the film, and why is he in love with a girl who treated him like this. This whole idea of ""falling in love"" with someone you don't know or know for 2 seconds and then going the entire film trying to save her and risk your life for it is ridiculous. Also what was the real reason for why the serial killer chose those women and killed them. I understand what happened to him in his childhood, but he already had two of those people involved in his building. Why would he need to harm random girls and then keep their heads as trophies. It felt ***like whoever wrote*** this movie just watched CSI for the first time and decided to incorporate bits and pieces of everything he saw into a movie that doesn't even make sense.The only good thing about this was Illayaraja's music but a waste of a decent cast .

31354,5 May 2020,Shnorg2342,Double Indemnity (1944),10.0,"Double Indemnity is quite possibly my favorite film noir, although Strangers on a Train and The Maltese Falcon are both up there. Double Indemnity stars Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff, an insurance salesman who partners up with Phyllis Dietrichson, a wife who wants to murder her husband and make some money while she's at it. Phyllis is played masterfully by Barbara Stanwyck, who rightfully earned an academy award nomination for the role. The film's script is air tight and to the point, clocking in at about 111 minutes. It was directed by the great Billy Wilder, and written by both Wilder and Raymond Chandler. The movie is narrated to us by Neff, who is confessing the events of the film to a tape recorder, which he plans for a friend to find.
SPOILERS START HERE
This film is perfect. It's perfectly written, directed, acted, and scored. What more could you want? The main motivation behind Neff's actions in the film is simple. He loves Phyllis, and he thinks he knows enough about his business to get away with it. But, as is illustrated to us by basically every Alfred Hitchcock film, no murder is perfect. The dynamic between Neff, and the man who eventually catches him Barton Keyes, a particularly talented insurance claim investigator played by Edward G. Robinson, is fascinating. Their mentor-and-apprentice relationship makes it all the more heartbreaking when Neff is eventually caught. But, ***like I said***, the film is about Walter and Phyllis. As the film goes by, we eventually realize that Phyllis is more than just the battered wife that she seems. Phyllis' character completely changes once Neff has murdered her husband for her. We actually get to see the moment her facade lets up. Interestingly, in this murder movie, we don't see the murder. Wilder instead chooses to focus on a part of the film that's more important than the murder that drives it. While Neff is breaking Mr. Dietrichson's neck, all we see is a close up of Phyllis' face, and how it changes from clear worry, to a devilish smirk once she hears the neck snap. She knows that her manipulation has prevailed, and that Neff has no way out of her web now that he's done the dirty work. Post murder, the movie takes place almost entirely in the background. Character's start to trust each other less and less, until eventually they start plotting against each other and into their graves. During tense scenes, the shots are blocked so that we always see every character and how they're reacting, even if they don't necessarily see each other, which is a masterwork on Wilder's part. It allows us to truly experience the tenseness of these scenes without them being influenced by a single character's point of view. The only other directors I've seen use blocking this well are Akira Kurosawa and John Carpenter. Well, it's getting late (it's 1:18 am) and I have to start my next movie soon, so that's all.",True
31496,5 May 2020,Shnorg2342,Strangers on a Train (1951),9.0,"Strangers on a Train is one of my favorite Hitchcock films, and one of my favorite film noirs. It's incredibly well made fun, although there are some things holding it back from perfection. Strangers on a Train stars Farley Granger as Guy Haines, a tennis star who is forced into a murder plot by a psychopath named Bruno Antony, who he randomly meets on a train. Bruno is played by Robert Walker, who is amazing in the role. The film's energetic script pairs fantastically with Alfred Hitchcock's suspenseful direction. While a bit silly, and much less dark and gritty than some noir movies, this movie is still extremely enjoyable. ***Like I said***, it does have some issues, the main one being Granger's flat performance as Guy. Farley's dullness is especially noticeable when he's put in confrontational scenes with Walker, who shines in his role. SPOILERS START HERE Strangers on a Train almost feels like two movies, with the first half focusing on Guy's dilemma of whether or not to go through with Bruno's plan or not, and the second focusing on a race/chase to obtain control of the lighter. The first half is the most noir-ish part. It's the darkest and has the most emotional conflict, culminating in a scene where Guy almost breaks. The stalking/murder scene is incredibly suspenseful, and I love the shot of the glasses reflecting on the murder. Also, Bruno lurking in the shadows of alleyways reminded me a lot of Orson Welles' Harry Lime in The Third Man. I think that this half is the best of the two, and it contains the most interesting scene in the entire movie, which I think ends up being sold a bit short by Granger's performance. The scene in question is where Guy goes to Bruno's house, unsure of whether or not he's going to murder Bruno's father. It's worth pointing out that Guy's tie in this scene has black and white stripes, signifying that his morals are being questioned. Guy ends up attempting to warn Bruno's father instead, and it's revealed that, due to a mix up, Bruno is where his father was supposed to be. This leads into both the second half, and a logical inconsistency I noticed. Bruno gave Guy a gun to kill his father with, but then when given the chance to kill Guy with the same gun, he opts not to, stating that the noise would wake his mother. Did he not realize that, had it all gone according to plan, Guy shooting the gun would have woken his mother? Anyway, the second half is structured strangely. First, we have set up for the chase, then we have Guy's tennis game which functions as the lead up to the chase, then we have the chase. The chase goes as follows: Bruno attempts to plant Guy's lighter at the old crime scene, Guy attempts to stop him, and the police, oblivious to the situation, attempt to stop Guy from stopping him. A simple enough premise, and it's executed well. This all culminates on a merry-go-round, which is accidentally launched into overdrive when the police accidentally shoot the merry-go-round operator. Guy and Bruno fight on the ride, and an old man crawl under the ride to stop it. This whole ending is very random, and intense, but it works really well, as an ending to the second half at least. My only complaint with the end is that it's so far removed from the first half, tonally speaking. The first is very methodical and interesting, while the second half, and the ending especially are both exciting, and a bit bonkers. Strangers on a Train is a great Hitchcock thriller, and a very fun and well made movie overall.",True
32007,10 February 2016,Hellmant,The Danish Girl (2015),8.0,"'THE DANISH GIRL': Four Stars (Out of Five)Eddie Redmayne is up for his second Best Actor Oscar, in two years, for his portrayal of a 1920s transgender Danish artist, named Lili Elbe; a pioneer of her time (after he won last year, for 'THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING'). Alicia Vikander is nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar; for playing Lili's wife, Gerda Wegener. The film was directed by Tom Hooper (who also directed the Academy Award winning films 'LES MISERABLES' and 'THE KING'S SPEECH'), and it was scripted by Lucinda Coxon. The movie was based on the 2000 novel, of the same name; which was only loosely inspired by the actual lives, of the Danish painters it portrays. The film has been heavily criticized; for it's historical inaccuracies, and it's questionable depiction of transgender people. Judging the movie, just on its own merits (as a film), I thought it was OK.The story takes place in 1920s Copenhagen. A successful landscape artist, named Einar Wegener (Redmayne), lives happily with his wife, Gerda (Vikander); who's a popular portrait painter. One day, Gerda asks Einar to sit in on a painting for her. He must pose in a dress, and women's shoes, in order to do so. This triggers feelings, that Einar has long kept buried inside; of identifying as a woman. The rest of the movie details her struggles to become one; and Gerda's fight to stay by her husband's side (during the battle).I don't know what it's like, at all, to be a transgender person; so I can't speak to how properly the film portrays it. I have a friend, who is a transgender woman, who says the movie doesn't do an appropriate job, of demonstrating what that life is ***like (there's multiple flaws in the film, she pointed out***). I also knew little about Lili Elbe, or Gerda Wegener, before seeing the movie; so I can't speak to it's historical accuracy, either (but I've read it's horribly inaccurate). I do think the film is well directed, emotionally intriguing and decently acted (although I don't think Redmayne deserved another Oscar nomination). It definitely kept my interest, throughout it's 2-hour running length; and Vikander is fantastic in it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b_aLk3J5gh4",True
32016,10 February 2016,lucasnochez,Fifty Shades of Black (2016),1.0,"It was only a matter of time that someone came along and spoofed the widely popular and highly alluring pop-culture phenomenon that was Fifty Shades of Grey. What isn't surprising is that spoof specialist and kinda, sorta washed up actor/writer Marlon Wayans was the one to do so. Wayans, whose previous parody films include A Haunted House 1 & 2, Dance Flick and Scary Movie 1-4 brings forth a very important question with his newest spoof feature Fifty Shades of Black; is the spoof film finally, officially dead? Its hard to believe but, after such classics as Airplane!, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and yes, even the original Scary Movie, the spoof film may slowly if not almost entirely die off and be resting in peace very soon.The world currently is one that is obsessed with social media platforms and media within these social networks. Thanks to applications such as Vine, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and YouTube, it seems that audiences everywhere are capable of finding comedy and entertainment, not only within the comfort of their own homes, but as easily and accessibly, within moments, within the palms of their hand.When the dawn of the television was upon us, people everywhere thought that televisions were going to destroy Hollywood and the history of feature films altogether; it didn't. With the rise of the Internet and the quickly developing moment of streaming and illegally downloading films and music online, people soon thought that the future of movies and music was on its way on the decline. Yet, in 2015 no less, two of the highest grossing films of all-time were released, and more than ever, the profitability of music has never been better. So, how and why is the spoof film genre dying slowly but surely?The thing about entertainment in 2016 is that, entertainment isn't merely measured but numbers and margins, but by memories and moments of experience and spectacle, with margins and numbers as well. Entertainment is constantly evolving, and the forms in which we consume entertainment maintains the ways in which we determine whether the entertainment itself is viable, or not. The thing with earlier spoof films ***like the ones that were mentioned*** above are, in order to consume such comedy, going to the movie theatres and watching it for yourself was the only way of consumption. Now a days, not only are films, genres and characters spoofed on the daily, but pop culture, with the help of social media, spoofs the crap out of anything and everything. Don't think thats the case? Think back, just in 2015, to all the spoofs you saw online about Adele's song Hello, Drake's music video to Hotline Bling, as well as anything else flooding the front pages of your vine, Instagram and Facebook news feeds.The beauty behind the genius in the earlier spoof films of the 80's and 90's was that accessibility was limited and, these films weren't just spoofing a specific movie, having limited content to work with. Think of Austin Powers for example, it wasn't just a spoof on spy films and a filmography of more than a dozen Bond films at that time, but also a genre, the unbelievability of a lifestyle or profession little to nothing is known about, as well as providing a fantasy for the possibility of the many beauties the life of what an international person of mystery might really be like. Sure, Black may spoof Kim K for a second, the Weeknd here and there, but overall, these small and insignificant and highly forgettable inclusions did nothing to elevate the plot or humour of the film overall.If you're wondering why I haven't really mentioned the plot line or story of Black, well, thats because the film is basically a shot-for-shot carbon copy of the original Grey film, with added crass and crude black jokes included, sexual innuendos juiced up to the max and of course, taking what the original did, and making it funny by stripping away its glamorous and polished exterior; essentially, making it real world scary for real life people. No matter how you look at it, regardless of how much money you have, any girl would be scared of having a wealthy man stalking you at work asking for ropes and zip-ties and what not.What I found super interesting with Black was how the film is slowly accepting and transitioning from movie stars, to social media stars starring within feature films. Sure we've seen Vine stars make cameos in films before, like Brittany Furland in last year's We Are Your Friends, but in Black, social media icon King Back/Andrew Bachelor has a very prominent role as the not so subtle yet totally obvious best friend Jesse that wants a piece, like any other straight male friend wants from their female friends. Bach represents not only a dominance of social media within feature films, but perhaps, the next phase and new generation of movies stars tomorrow. Plus, is it just me or does Bach remind anyone else of a younger Will Smith?Sure Black states the obvious humours that we found in the original Grey film, but the beauty of Fifty Shades of Grey was that it knew that it was going to be the basis to much criticism, the butt end of endless jokes and spoof online for weeks and months after its release. Luckily for the film, made on only $40 million dollar, its return really laughed in all the faces of sceptics and all its negative criticism. Fifty Shades of Grey broke these records; highest grossing film directed by a woman, highest grossing February release and #1 President Day 4-Day Holiday Weekend (all of these numbers NOT adjusted for inflation). So I guess, the joke is on us, especially since they numbers and records are bound to be broken once the newest instalment of the series is released in 2017.",True
32076,10 February 2016,kira02bit,Hudson Hawk (1991),2.0,"Comic action film centering on crackerjack cat burglar Bruce Willis, fresh from prison, who is blackmailed into stealing priceless works of art by a psychotic wealthy couple (Richard A. Grant and Sandra Bernhard) lest they murder his best friend Danny Aeillo.Hudson Hawk is notorious in the annals of legendary horrible film-making as a total debacle. Still, such films can be fun in retrospect. Not so much for this one. Willis is the driving creative force behind the film (and I use creative cautiously), having been a producer, writer and lead actor. One wonders why he stopped himself from stepping into the director's chair, but I guess even Willis has his limits, so he graciously allows director Michael Lehman to fall on the sword in that capacity. One would think since Willis wrote the mess of a screenplay that it would at least play to his strengths. If so, then one can only presume that constant smirking and smug arrogance are Willis' only cards to play. Truthfully, if an actress had perpetrated this worthless spectacle, her career would have been over before the print on the first reviews was dry. As evidence of the Hollywood double standard, Willis was allowed to carry on despite disastrous box office with nary a blip.The film's biggest clever flourish is having Willis and Aeillo carry out their heists in time to music. It sounds much better than it plays. And one comes to the fast conclusion that this was less an interesting idea, then an attempt to allow Willis and Aeillo, neither particularly good singers, to defile some otherwise sturdy old standards.The plot - or whatever you call this - is so insane and all over the map that it is virtually incomprehensible. It plays ***like something someone wrote*** after a major bender and while still experiencing intermittent black-outs. A perfect example is the leading lady role. Andie MacDowell looks luminous, but literally seems to have no idea what she is doing in this film (nor do we for that matter). She is cast as an undercover secret agent nun dispatched by the Vatican to...who knows. Ironically casting MacDowell as a nun means that Willis does not have to waste time developing any romantic chemistry with her and, although she manages to be present for the film's concluding action scenes, she functions as little more than adornment or furniture for all the impact she has.The less said about Willis in the title role, the better. Grant and especially Bernhard are virtually unendurable contributing unwatchable performances as the Nick and Nora Charles of villainy. Truthfully, we never have much of an idea of what they are up to and they seem less villainous than simply an endurance test for the viewer, often shrieking their lines as though they caught their big toe in a mouse trap. Aeillo is equally appalling. With Do the Right Thing and Moonstruck, Aeillo seemed briefly to actually be a decent actor, before degenerating in whiny second banana/bad character roles. Here, he is supposed to be funny and winning, but instead seems oddly pathetic and has never more than here resembled an overgrown mutant man-child. One can easily see him cast as the big screen's Baby Huey with no make-up or costume required. At one point, his character seemingly hurls to a fiery death and one realizes what a relief it is to no longer have him on screen.Willis's vanity piece is perpetually dumb where it should be funny, smug where it should be clever, loud and chaotic where it should be exciting, boring where it should be fast-paced, and finally a complete waste of space and time.",True
32119,10 February 2016,andreasanyhow,American Crime Story (2016– ),1.0,"I honestly don't get it. First of all, let me just say: I really wanted this to be good... Honestly! I mean, we're all fascinated by the original story, so it obviously had potential. We're two episodes in at this point and I don't even know where to start. I guess my first question is: why on earth are so many of you in awe of this show? I'm beginning to suspect that I'm center stage in some sort of version of ""The Truman Show"". Why? Because this production is a complete farce! Quite simply a parody of epic proportions! First of all: the atrocious plug-fest of the Kardashian-family is the most embarrassing thing I've seen on TV since I can remember and the numerous ""dramatic"" fast close-ups looks completely ridiculous, but it's not just that. Literally every line uttered on ""American Crime Story"" is so cliché it hurts... The acting is downright laughable across the board, but there's honestly no need to blame the actors. They're doing the very best they can with a script that reeks to high heaven. The telenovela-style directing obviously doesn't help either. But still, most of you seem to love it... Are standards slipping? Are reviewers ""forced"" or paid to praise certain shows? I don't know.What I do know is that this could've been a top notch criminal drama. It could've had us on the edge of our seats despite the fact that we know the outcome, but no... It's a soap opera of the lowest possible standard. By all means; the sets look nice, the production value is good, the resemblance to real-life characters is not bad, despite the obvious point that Cuba is a bit too small. Maybe he should've borrowed the box that his former co-star Tom Cruise uses to stand on to see eye-to-eye with his co-stars? However, ***like I said***, that's not the problem! The script is simply ridiculous. I can't emphasize this enough! It's truly so over-the-top that it feels like a parody skit!Now, of course: I have to continue watching to see if A) it gets better or B) it gets worse... I'm having a hard time picturing how it can get worse, but hey... We'll soon find out! In the meanwhile, let's all chant: ""Kardashian, Kardashian, Kardashian""... and then throw up!",True

There's no place for movies that embody the very thing cinema was invented for: the magical power of limitless imagination.From George Lucas's wonderful creations to Avatar, from very original tales like The Golden Compass or Stardust to John Carter, movies that do not fit in today's bitter world are bashed endlessly, or outright bomb at the box office, as John Carter did. However, if you, ***like me, refuse to bow to this lack of imagination, and liked the aforementioned*** movies, then you'll probably fall in love with John Carter, too. It is truly amazing.

Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made.

33175,3 September 2011,Lejink,Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009),3.0,"Loosely based on Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"", only transported to the modern day and with the Scrooge character transformed from an elderly miser to an ageing Romeo, played by Matthew McConaghey. What can I say, typical rom-com, peopled with Christmas card thin characters, contrived plot which magically resolves itself by the obligatory happy ending, plenty of crass jokes and only a couple of smile-inducing ones (when a character literally introduces a montage sequence to Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" and a neat reversal of the old Scrooge line ""Is today Christmas?"". The rest is a mixture of played-out sexist humour, some weary slapstick with a couple of sappy love stories and some fantasy effects thrown in. Not once in the film do you get any idea why McConaghey's Connor Mead character is so irresistible to women, nor do you ever believe that he could be related to his screen brother, but I guess I'm looking too deeply into the wrong end of what was a shallow pool to begin with.As for the acting, McConaghey in the lead radiates precisely zilch in the charm and humorous stakes, while I found myself unwittingly judging a Botox competition between Anne Archer and Jennifer Garner. A heavily made-up Michael Douglas ghosts in and out the film to no great effect and there's a pretty ropey 80's soundtrack for good measure (Poison? REO Speedwagon?).I guess this film was aimed at thirty-somethings who hanker after old-school music and ***like their laughs cheap and their films soufflé-light and full of beautiful people just ripe for a morality makeover but as Sam Goldwyn once said***, ""Include me out"".",True

I can't watch a film noir without giving credit to the movie which first interested me in the genre to begin with, ""King Creole"".Because I like ""King Creole"" so much, I decided I'd like to see some other films in the same noir genre, so after I discovered ""Double Indemnity"" was available instant stream on Netflix, I thought I'd give it a go and I'm glad I did! I can clearly understand why so many people consider this movie a classic. It is! Don't let the fact the film was made in 1944 fool you. It's not ""too old"" to watch...not by a long shot. In fact, I found the movie more suspenseful and entertaining than just about everything that's being released nowadays.The actors turn in great performances, particularly Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck.

When the actual story began unfolding, I was literally spell-bounded.Its not very often that we come across such a tragic and evoking story matched by a strong acting performance.

The fact that the original writer of this movie is half Japanese is clearly Visible in the way this movie was so delicate and humble.

All the Characters combine for wonderful story lines. Aunt Zelda the Leader of the Spellman Family Lucy Davis as the Comic Relief Aunt Hilda, great looking young actors just like Riverdale it's a great formula. Is it goofy yes is it a bit disturbing with Satan worship for sure. I an not comfortable with that ***like I said*** Guilty Pleasure.

I remember watching this movie a very long time ago, and I can't believe how much I enjoyed it. I was very impressed especially this movie in particular. It felt like some sort of classic! There have been in total five Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and they were all wonderful, but the one that holds true for many is probably the first one which nobody can forget about. It was this movie which started it all. What I really enjoyed about this movie was the start. The way the movie was introduced was breathtaking! It really got me interested, and of course, the rest of the movie. The story was wonderful and beautiful. I liked how serious the story was even though it was funny at times. Somehow, the humour just worked. There were many characters we were introduced with, and most people favourite was probably Jack Sparrow. I really liked Jack Sparrow. There's something special about him. You could tell when you see him in this movie how special he is - a wonderful pirate. Everyone supports him in his adventure. He made this movie succeed, and was so funny too. My favourite character, though, within the movie was Will Turner. I also liked Elizabeth Swann who happens to be a romantic interest for Will Turner. I always wanted these two to be together as soon as I saw them: it's a romantic relationship. A lot of people liked that. They were both attracted to one another. It was so sweet. It was hard for me to choose between Jack Sparrow and Will Turner - toss of the coin really. Will Turner reminds me of someone, and so does Elizabeth Swann. I also like the music. I think the soundtracks were wonderful to listen to. It's even nice listening to outside the movie. This was a great movie for the following movies - the sequels. ***Like I said***, it's the story which I find interesting, but I think the first one, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" has the best of stories.

Maybe I should watch it again when I'm not bored but as a fan of the book, which is hauntingly brilliant. I am legit so annoyed by this film.They made it because they could but I honestly don't believe the director or the producers (or even the actors) truly knew what they were dealing with.It's meant to be tense at the very least but it kind of felt like; scene, scene, scene, scene. Let's move this plot along people!I enjoy Taissa Farmiga but Merricat was all wrong here. She is disturbed certainly, but her tics (the movements she chose to do) felt completely out of place. It was the wrong way to go with this character.For example; in the book, everyone in the town is very wary of Merricat and thinks that she, and her family are weirdos,(Which to be fair to the town, they are) but the movie goes out of its way to show just how strange she is by adding a fun quirk!On a film like this you shouldn't have to make the character do ""weird"" things to get this point across. It should be clear enough anyway. Taissa is normally great in scary movies but because this wasn't even spoopy it just fell flat for me.Alexandria Daddario felt completely out of place for me as Constance. You are meant to feel pity/empathy for her (well I always have in the book - for taking the fall for what your sister did. Constantly worn down by people. Constantly chasing her uncle and Merricat around. Afraid to do anything wrong. Just constant anxiousness and worrying about the household and cleanliness. Constance always had weight behind her character.) and it just feels like in this she's just there to move the story along. I didn't feel anything for her character other than ""oh she's on the screen again"".Crispin Glover (whom I love) felt completely underutilised with this role (understatement for the entire film) and it's just sad to see him involved in this.And Sebastian Stan...Hmm...""10/10 Sebastian was great!""**I am saying this AS A FAN OF HIS.****This is not how movie reviews are meant to work people!!**.Almost all of the 10/10 reviews of this movie mention him. He isn't great in this. He just isn't, and the movies isn't great just because he is in it. It is okay to call out bad acting and bad movies. If you only lump praise on people, well you get movies like this. If you can't see that this is a bad movie because you are blinded by your thirstiness, go outside.This was not a good film because he looked cute in it.His character who is domineering and powerful and scary in the book, is just ...meh. literal embodiment of meh.I felt nothing for his character. I felt no tension. It feels ***like the producers said*** ""Sebastian's cute. Alexandria's cute, let's get them to star in this gothic horror, it'll be greaaaaaaat!:.Honestly what odds are there for Merricat to come up against here with this version of Charles? He played Charles as: *obvious bad guy* with alterior motives from the begining.-I kind of wish they had made him wear a long thin mustache so that he could twirl it. That would have at least been hammy enough to keep me mildly entertained.-Sebastian also looks LEGIT bored the entire time he is on screen which kindof (REALLY) pulls you out of the film and this, sadly, is already a boring, forgetable film that could've been great if it had had the right people who cared enough to make a great film, rather than just a film, behind it.Not surprised they pushed this one out hoping no-one would have noticed.Honestly don't think i'll watch this again.Everyone please do give the book a read though! It's not particularly long and it is super atmospheric, spooky and very thought-provoking. Everything this movie should have been but isn't.2/10",True
34875,27 February 2020,MartinHafer,B.F.'s Daughter (1948),3.0,"""B.F.'s Daughter"" lost a lot of money at the box office and it's very easy to see why when you watch the movie. BOTH leading characters in this romantic drama are jerks in their own way....and making them both that way pretty much guarantees that the audience will dislike the film.Polly Fulton (Barbara Stanwyck) is an odd woman. She's the daughter of a rich industrialist (Charles Coburn) and is dating a very steady, sober guy....in other words, he's a bit dull. So it's not completely understanding that she'd be infatuated with Tom Brett (Van Heflin). However, anything beyond infatuation simply makes no sense. She's a rich debutante and he's an angry guy who thinks he knows everything and eschews wealth. The fact they meet, fall in love and get married in hates indicates the marriage will be rocky. Well, initially it isn't and Tom allows Polly to do and spend what she wants of her father's money. But over time, he's resentful...resenting what he chose. In fact, both chose types totally un***like their stated*** philosophies and seem to spend much of the movie changing the other to be like them. I couldn't help but think that Polly marrying Tom was dumb and over time, that seems to be the case in the movie.As I said above, I really didn't like Polly nor Tom. Both seemed self-absorbed and a bit dim when it came to the marriage. Certainly the film is anything but romantic...and isn't much fun to watch. I also strongly dislikes Keenan Wynn's character...who seems out of place in the film. Overall, a big mistake of a film due to a script that was just hopeless and unlikable.By the way, although the film begins in 1932, the clothes and hair are strictly 1948...especially Stanwyck. This is pretty lazy and I am surprised a major studio didn't work harder to get the look right.",True

Season 3 was a crap though. I felt like Midge became unlikeable. Abe and Rose didn't make any sense. There was zero chemistry between Joel and that girl (who's name I forget) and zero between Midge and Bruce. And like every show nowadays, it felt overly political at times.
The worst part was the ending when Midge says goodbye to her baby like it was no big deal...even making a joke out of not hearing her say her first words. But then she's sobbing when she's told she won't be going back on tour.

35107,6 July 2020,ejoshcoronado,Hamilton (2020),3.0,"I feel these criticisms are not trivial, they are musical/storytelling/songwriting fundamentals1. With very few exceptions, the songs that aren't just rapping have very little melody. It's almost ***like if you gave someone a page of dialogue and said*** ""instead of saying this, make it into a song on the spot"". It really often feels like there's that little planning put into the melody structure. Contrast that with the music in The Book of Mormon, where nearly every song is an earworm, and incredibly well written.2. Add to that the lyrics themselves, same thing. If you told me the show was improvised on the spot (Which is exactly what Lin did with his group Freestyle Love Supreme) then I could be impressed. But it's not. Lin had time to pre-write this. They're so basic, and repeat SO much. I can't believe the quality of writing choruses like ""I want to be in the room where it happened, the room where it happened, the room where it happened"". Look at the lyrics to The Story of Tonight:
I may not live to see our glory
I may not live to see our glory
But I will gladly join the fight
But I will gladly join the fight
And when our children tell our story
And when our children tell our story
They'll tell the story of tonight

They'll tell the story of tonightThey just repeat themselves so much, it's so hard to stay engaged with lyrics like this. You find this throughout the show.3. In Lin you have a man you cannot sing surrounded by phenomenal Broadway singers and it is jarring. If he wanted to put the quality of his play first he wouldn't have taken the lead role.4. This is a story that is complex, covering numerous historical figures, events, policies, court cases, places and dates. And you choose to rap it? It makes it incredibly difficult to catch all of the information they're firing off. I didn't want to but I ended up having to keep the subtitles on.5. Finally, in my opinion, even if this wasn't rap or even a musical, just scenes, I don't feel like it was a cohesive, well paced or structured story/choice of scenes to represent Hamilton's story. It jumps around so much, to different time periods and events. Now suddenly a whole song about some other character who just got introduced halfway through the show. it just felt scattered. Telling the story a man's whole life that was surrounded by so many consequential historical events is a titanic undertaking. It takes an incredible amount dedication and thought and talent. Knowing what it essential to keep in the story, and what should be shed. Where the focus should lie. I like Lin, been a fan since his early appearances in Collegehumor videos, I just feel unequivocally that he did not succeed in pulling this off.To me kind of an exception and the highlight of the show is like 15min in: The Schuyler Sisters and their song. Those three were great together. Special shoutout to Peggy, who kind of stole the show with like 4 lines.",True

36703,8 December 2019,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,We Have Always Lived in the Castle (2018),9.0,"Ma was a serious Shirley Jackson fan, and I remember trying to read this one when I was a kid, but I was still into Dr. Doolittle and the Hardy Boys at the time, and this gothic tale about two reclusive sisters living in a fortresslike mansion with their dotty uncle was a bit above my pay grade. One thing that stayed with me was this taunting nursery rhyme, which is all we get as a backstory for a while: ""Merricat, said Connie, would you ***like a cup of tea? Oh no, said*** Merricat, you'll poison me.""Stacie Passon's film adaptation of Jackson's novel is brilliant, visually and dramatically. I don't know whether the decision to film on the east coast of Ireland was esthetic or economic, but the acid greens and phosphorescent yellows of the rain-soaked woods furnish the perfect backdrop for Merricat's obsessive rituals, burying coins and magic charms while chanting protective spells. Taissa Farmiga, now in her mid-twenties, gives a fine spooky performance as the elflike teenage Merricat, and bodacious Alexandra Daddario gets to stretch a bit more than she did in ""Baywatch,"" I'm guessing, as elder sister Connie, who floats dreamily through a fantasy of gracious country living, baking pies in the kitchen and pottering in the garden. Connie can only venture a few steps from their door--for reasons we can only guess at initially--so Merricat makes a weekly trip to town, enduring the taunts and threats of the locals (at least one of whom seems to have a valid grievance).Jackson's novel is, essentially, a tale told by a psychopath. It's also a tale of WASPy repression, since the decisive events in the sisters' lives are something they never speak of--Merricat ties up the loose ends for us in voiceover as she writes in her journal. Fans of the genre won't be surprised when a disrupter turns up, a smarmy cousin who tempts Connie with fantasies of an Italian honeymoon. The psychic bond between the sisters is threatened, and for the second time in their lives, one of them (no spoilers here!) is required to step up and take care of business.""Castle"" seems close to a perfect film, though limited by the conventions of the gothic genre. The sisters' emotional responses are overdetermined by the usual murky ""family secrets,"" and the climax reveals how, as in Jackson's canonical story ""The Lottery,"" they've been made scapegoats for the suppressed violent impulses of an entire community. It's interesting to compare this one (favorably) with a showoffy formal exercise like ""Stoker,"" which also owes a lot to Jackson's novel, but where color coding the sets and costumes seems to have been more of a priority than developing the relationships among the characters.",True

37030,12 December 2008,rupert_alexander,Feardotcom (2002),10.0,"First of all I have to say I never usually bother with registering for internet accounts to leave comments but here I feel the need to help right a great wrong.The other reviewers (OR) tell us this film is awful, not worth watching even for the fun of watching a bad film, in a new dimension of awfulness, save your rental money and other cruel comments.So I decided to watch it just to see how bad a bad film can be. I was so disappointed - it actually *wasn't* half bad!! I think what is happening here is everyone is jumping on the band-waggon and is afraid of saying anything against the general consensus. I say this because a lot of these (very) negative comments only seem to highlight the same aspects of the movie.OK the film is not perfect or an epic of our times, it has its faults of course which I can't remember really - mainly as the incongruities don't impinge on this film nearly as much as the OR would have you believe.SPOILERS COMING UP!! If you like films like Videodrome then you will like this movie (though not as intense as VD).The basic tenet of this movie is the internet is behaving ***like a neural net (an interesting proposition and not beyond the realms of possibility - i like the bit in the movie where the cop/female scientist meet the guy who had this theory and he tells them its a load of crap: he only wrote*** it because he needed money for a new car - so in a way the film debunks its own silliness!) and has evolved its own energy/consciousness born of all the bad vibes going in, and the ghost of the murdered woman is utilising this energy for her own website (feardotcom) to lead people to her killer (the Doctor), and as the stick to make them succeed if they don't do it in 48 hours (the time it took for her to die at the hands of the doctor) well they die too, which is fair enough considering it is internet users logging onto the Doctors 'swot' site which drive his online killing spree, plus the ghost of the woman uses the 48 hour time limit to develop a pattern in the deaths which finally gets noticed by the cop/female scientist.I think this is where some OR get confused - the doctor's site and the ghost's site (feardotcom) are NOT the same thing! The victims of feardotcom die a grisly death - they begin to suffer hallucinations based on their own mortal fears which become so insufferable they are driven to suicide, or given a nudge anyway by the ghost of the murdered woman to keep them in the 48 hour time-frame! So the cop/female scientist inevitably, and separately, look at feardotcom and themselves become affected and start to suffer hallucinations. Now the film gets interesting - it becomes difficult to distinguish between the reality in the film and the hallucinations they are suffering - there is an interaction taking place between the cop/female scientist and the ghost who is leading them to her killer.There is an interesting symbiosis developing: internet users log on to the doctor's site to see people die which drives the doctor's insanity but increases the negative energy in the neural net making feardotcom and the ghost of the woman stronger and more able to affect feardotcom visitors and thus influence the physical world, leading to the whereabouts of the Doctor (if only they could understand the hallucinations).Eventually they all catch up with each other: but it doesn't end like most horror movies with the protagonists holding hands and laughing about it.So in praise of this film: The plot is ingenious and contains themes worth more thought eg. can there be feedback from an anonymous medium ***like the internet which can impact individually on the user or collectively on society as a whole: by making this more explicit is where this film departs from Ringu, which OR have said*** this film 'rips off'. This is a large and interesting theme and I am sure there will be more films based on it - will they all be 'rip-offs' too? The actors *can* act (except for the bimbo who gets lured to her death - but then what do expect from a bimbo in a horror movie who gets lured to her death?!).The hallucination sequences, as said by OR, are great.The production values are high enough.The gore is as graphic as it needs to be - the fate of the young Germans at the beginning is largely left to our imaginations which lends an atmosphere of impending menace to the film.The cop/female scientist *do* call backup - he just ends up pinned to the wall! The female scientist is *not* stabbed with a big knife in the neck - it is a close-up of a hypodermic syringe being plunged into her neck to drug her and incapacitate her, to facilitate the Doctor making her his next victim - a truly terrifying prospect for her.So maybe its not a 10 really (at least 7 though!) but as I said the balance needs readdressing!",True
37209,12 December 2008,swim_freak777,The Wedding Date (2005),2.0,"""The Wedding Date"" follows the neurotic Kat Ellis as she prepares for her little half-sister's wedding in London. However, since her former boyfriend dumped her, she hires a male escort, named Nick, to pose as her new boyfriend (because, no matter how successful you might be, being single means you're a total loser and failure at life). When she hires this escort, though, she soon founds out he's also a male prostitute. Things get even more complicated when she gets to London and reunites with her former flame...I'm not the type of girl who's very partial to chick flicks, but if I'm at a get together, or such, with a bunch of other girls, I don't mind them. If you have a bunch other other people watching it with you, it usually makes the movie more fun, enjoyable, and bearable. However, I am sad to say, even when watching it with a bunch of friends of mine, ""The Wedding Date,"" was still excruciating.This is, of course, a movie that is perfectly happy with following a formula. I'm sure most people have seen or heard of at least one other romantic comedy following a plot that includes prostitute and client falling in love, former flames, or getting a date for a wedding/some other social outing to not look like a loser (or all three). But this movie is not one of the good ones.Now normally with silly little romantic comedies such as this one, I try to ignore the fact that it is indeed formulaic and has been done before. However, with better romantic comedy movies, they at least try to have something good about them; fresh jokes, good witty dialog, enjoyable characters, etc. But, this movie does not. The plot sucks and over used and the jokes are boring, dull, and recycled from better (and worse) material. Most of the characters are shallow, stereotypical, and annoying. The main character Kat, is neurotic and grates on the nerves. Also, her former boyfriend, I don't see how she ever fell in love with that spineless, dick faced jerk. Her sister is ditsy and bitchy. However, I do think that Dermot Mulroney's performance as Nick was passable, especially compared to the other performances. I think it's unfortunate that the actors got stuck in this movie. Debra Messing, I believe (and ***like some other reviews have said***), is a rather talented, bright and energetic actress. However, her talents can't be show cased in a movie like this. Over all, I just say skip this movie. It's not really worth the time.",True
37298,12 December 2008,Aaron1375,Punisher: War Zone (2008),9.0,"Yes, this movie unlike the previous two Punisher movies really is what the Punisher comic book character is like. It is also very poorly received by movie critics as they just were aghast of all the violence in the film, most of which involves the Punisher doing away with criminals in rather satisfying fashion. I really enjoyed this incarnation of the Punisher myself, as ***like I said*** it portrays the Punisher as he is portrayed in the comics more than any other film. Granted I enjoyed the one with Thomas Jane quite a lot as well. As for the story, once again it is not a sequel so knowing either of the other two movies is not necessary to enjoy this film. Liking bad guys getting killed in very gruesome ways and not minding lots of blood are rather necessary for liking this film. The film does not show how the Punisher came to be except in brief flashback scenes, however, the flashbacks are more in line with how it happened in the comics. Right of the bat, the Punisher goes in and kills a lot of mob types in a rather grisly and gruesome shoot em up. Very nice start, as there was more gun play in this opening sequence than in the entire Max Payne movie released this same year. After taking care of a mansion full of these guys he heads to the docks where he accidentally shoots an insider from the FBI and really does a number on one particular mob guy who really liked his own looks. What happens next is an FBI agent now wants to really bring in the Punisher for the death of the inside guy, Frank (Punisher) is thinking of not being the Punisher because of this death, and the mobster becomes the crime boss Jigsaw and breaks his crazy brother out of jail to try and get revenge on the Punisher. So you get lots of kills to follow in a very wild ride. Lots of bullets expended as well, and a rather satisfying conclusion as the Punisher really takes care of business and pounds the bad guys.",True

37361,12 December 2008,Pierre_Kirby,Frost/Nixon (2008),8.0,"What negative things can we say about Ron Howard? He narrated Arrested Development, he starred in Happy Days, he has Clint Howard as a brother, and he always makes good, solid and entertaining films. As such is the case with his latest biopic- Frost/Nixon. It treads mostly on requisite Howard ground, and some people might say this is just another 'Oscar Bait' film filled with Oscar Bait-ish principles. But you know what? Most of those people forgot that the film is actually pretty damn good.The film basically follows the famous Frost and Nixon interview in the late 70's; what happened in and outside of said event. We get to see the overall preparation of the interview, the comedy bits between Rockwell and Oliver Platt (James Reston Jr and Bob Zelnick respectively), the drama involving David Frost and his near-impossible challenge, his love interest, Kevin Bacon insulting Frost's shoes, a drunk Nixon talking about cheeseburgers, and the third act which can be summed up as- a happy ending. All shot of course in stylized cinematography and editing, with gorgeous production design backing everything up. Now, there is a lot of hype with this film, and the reason isn't because of Michael Sheen.Sad to say that while Sheen does admirably in most scenes, he is nothing compared to the towering performance of Frank Langella as Nixon. Hell, I thought it was going to be something resembling a parody; an over-hyped, average performance, just like George Clooney in Syriana, or Sandra Bullock in Erin Brokovich. And yes, ladies and gentleman, I WAS VERY F*CKING WRONG.I underestimated Langella, which has proved himself better than Anthony Hopkins in my eyes. Because it isn't just about looking like Nixon, it is about emulating him and all of his subtle emotions, expressions, you name it. Langella nails it with intense precision and 'no-holds barred' aggression that I quite simply felt just like Sheen in the film- awe-struck. Which makes me wonder if Sheen was really awe-struck in his scenes with Langella...In other news, the rest of the acting was efficient. Rockwell and Platt did their usual characters, Bacon was a no-nonsense military officer, and Rebecca Hall looked pretty. I think Howard didn't really bother with the other characters; I think he knew from the get-go that this was a going to be vehicle movie for Langella. Meh, I don't blame him.The result of the equation is an 8.2 out of 10. But WAY?!, you may ask. Well, this film felt just ***like any other Howard Drama (there will be no surprises here), but the difference being that the supportive acting wasn't as memorable or as good as said*** Drama's. But what we get to see though, is one of the best performances of the year by Frank Langella, and that in itself is reason for admission.8.2/10",True
37739,13 December 2008,David_Powell3006-1,"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Rocks and Shoals (1997) Season 6, Episode 2",9.0,"I had to write a review for this, because it is one of my favorite episodes of a very, very well put together TV series. So, here we go.This one starts off with Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks,) his Chief of Operations Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) and their small group crash landed on a small planetoid, where they run into another similarly cut-off group made up of enemy troops. This one reminded me a bit of some of the classics ***like ""The Outer Limits"" where a very complex plot that said*** a lot got into an hour long show (including commercials) which stood very well on it's own. Or, some of the Original Star Trek's episodes.In a TV series, there is often the question of ""story arc"" vs. ""stand alone"" episodes. Ones where characters develop along a progressive track vs. ones a person who hasn't seen an episode can instantly get. Deep Space Nine had some significant arcs, but this is a show that works well in both ways I mentioned.In the show Sisko comes to get to know something about a couple of the enemy troops, I won't go further, and it is a very tight and well written plot about wars, commanders, loyalty and the collision of respect for a foe and duty to one's men. Also, instead of action across solar systems or galaxies, the action is now restricted to walking distance of a small area of a small out of the way planet. Everything is tight for our characters here, including time.For the fans of the show watching, all the actors on board give good performances. It is also kind of chilling to see Nog, once a boy on the station and now a soldier, partner up with Mr. Garak, sent by Sisko to observe him, stay close to him, and learn. This isn't about our friend Nog going to see how Garak stitches a shirt either, and it says something about the best of our young people and sending them to learn certain things when their lives and ours are on the line. It is something that works in the story as a stand alone, sending a younger character out with someone known to be skilled, but for those who have followed the show and know both characters it is increased in the impact. Also, Colm Meaney does very well, from his work with a couple guest actors on his crew to his work with the regulars. His part where he is arguing to err on the side of humanity if one must err at a certain point is fascinating.Also aboard and adding to the anthology feel are a couple of guest actors who really inhabit their well-written characters. DS9 had a lot of that, and Phil Morris as Remata'Klan and Christopher Shea as Keevan (OK, forget the funny names and makeup, just watch it for acting and character and you won't be disappointed) are no exception.I won't spoil it further, but this is a very well done show that takes the concept I explained of the two small groups and which really makes you think. For a show which might have been considered part of an arc it really stands on it's own.There is one difference between this show and the classic episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits."" No narration. However, Avery Brooks' tone of voice at the end delivers all the summary that is needed.Worth watching, there isn't a bad performance in it and the writing is great. It also points to a lot of things about duty, command, and the burdens of both.",True
37957,14 December 2008,Mightyzebra,Feed the Kitty (1952),8.0,"I thought this cartoon was very sweet, not the best of all time, ***like many people said***, but certainly very well worth watching and a good thing to see to cheer someone up. It reminded me of ""Pluto and the Armadillo"", because of some of the plot turnings and the roles of Marc Anthony (who is at first a very gruff bulldog then a sympathetic toddler-like dog) and Pussyfoot (who is a kitten the size of a mouse who is incredibly cute, sweet and unaware of danger). Another reviewer on here pointed out that something in this Looney Tunes cartoon was like something that happened in Monsters Inc, which I agree with. I enjoyed this cartoon for the sweetness of it, the plot-theme, the ending and the evolving character of Marc Anthony. I thought some of the animation was a bit underdone, some of the jokes were boring and slapsticky and the backgrounds looked too much like a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Apart from that, well worth a viewing. :-)In this short, the fierce bulldog Marc Anthony is barking savagely at a tiny kitten he finds sleeping in a tin can. The kitten, cleaning himself, is completely oblivious to Marc Anthony and even sleeps in his fur.

It had political overtones. It showed how if we don't curb the way we run our judicial system, the police may end up running our lives. It dealt with archaic governments; it dealt with cloning and all kinds of things that could happen in the future. It was also bigger than any film I've done in its physical stature and the way it was designed. All the people were dwarfed by the system and the architecture; it shows how insignificant human beings could be in the future. There's a lot of action in the movie and some great acting, too. It just wasn't balls to the wall. But I do look back on Judge Dredd as a real missed opportunity. It seemed that lots of fans had a problem with Dredd removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. But for me it is more about wasting such great potential there was in that idea, just think of all the opportunities there were to do interesting stuff with the Cursed Earth scenes. It didn't live up to what it could have been. It probably should have been much more comic, really humorous, and fun. What I learned out of that experience was that we shouldn't have tried to make it Hamlet; it's more Hamlet and Eggs that's what he said the film director for me was idiot Judge Dredd doesn't take out his Hamlet i agree maybe the director said F**ck his idea then the director did his own so he thinks Judge Dredd Fans people might think it's going to be great but you know what you didn't do it well i ***like movie like i said*** i love Action scenes him fighting with Rico was awesome and motorbike flying Motorbike and cops chasing Stallone was awesome start is Kinda Same as Dredd (2012) in Apartment shooting kinda same but 2 different movies but in Judge Dredd (1995) was kinda same at start in Apartment shoot out then in Dredd in awesome movie different not remake more of restart like batman Begins but different movies so Judge Dredd awesome and Dredd 2012 awesome both different movies if your a Stallone fan or Judge Dredd witch ones would you like better then first watch this one don't listen to fans they read comic books they comic book reader me i am not i am watch movies so yeah i enjoy this movie 8/10 for only Sylvester Stallone and worth watching action scenes it's still good movie but nots great as Cobra (1986) its like dredd but old version in different movie watch Cobra (1986) then watch Dredd (2012)you will understand",True

I enjoyed the first one, Film Geek and The Auteur was festive, if a mess at times.I made it 21 minutes into this flick before giving up. I cannot speak of the rest of the film, but by this point I wanted to take an Uzi to the entire production. I found none of the characters well drawn or compelling. The use of racist language was so off-putting that I gave up.I hated Meris. I hated that she loved her stupid, pathetic husband. I loathed and despised his so-called friends. Everyone was creepy and poorly written and pathetically shot and hideously performed/directed. It looked ***like something they wrote*** in a fit and thought it was somehow interesting or compelling.

Not a good film by any stretch of the imagination; however, I will give it points for having a certain bit of creativity to it. It was not boring and it was fun making fun of it. Though I am not going to make a habit of watching these films as they are lazy for the most part alluding to the only really good shark film in existence ""Jaws"". Sharknado started up after this one, and that film made this one instantly better as the concept in it was simply too ludicrous. Granted, this one is not believable either, but they have a better concept than a pod of sharks getting sucked up into a hurricane!The story here has a deceased shark going on the rampage as a ghost! Yes, it is insane and it is a way to do a shark on screen and make it look less real than the usual computer generated shark in other films. It also sets up for some interesting and funny kills. I did so enjoy the slip and slide part of the film. The film though has a hard time trying to extend this rather flimsy concept into a full film. Richard Moll of Night Court fame plays the grizzled guy who may know what is going on and has a secret! The film is very bad, but it has enough interesting elements to keep it from being unwatchable and horrid. ***Like I said***, Sharknado came on after this and it was worse and I just could not even sit through it. This one had something to it that kept it a bit interesting and it did some things that made it fun. I predicted a couple of the deaths before they occurred. Ricard Moll was fun to see to hamming it up. The mayor though and all the kids were annoying. I so wanted one more kill at the end as the kids were swimming and doing their Jaws shtick.",True

41305,27 February 2020,jon-oivind,iHuman (2019),8.0,"Tonje Hessen Schei clearly has an agenda with this film. It is not a neutral dissertation of AI, its potential and dangers. We are in the middle of a revolution in terms of AI, though true AI seems rather far away still. (Current ML, ""deep learning"" algorithms and synthetic neural networks are actually very primitive compared to the human intelligences that created them). Hessen Schei said in an introduction to the screening I attended that she thinks there is too little attention paid to and conversation about AI in terms of how it will change society, democracy and the way we live. Even though I use ML and ""AI"" in my work and know the tech fairly well, I still found the framing and the questions asked in the film to be engadging. Some of the talking heads come off as rather naive, despite all their apparent brilliance. I found it amusing that some of these highly intelligent people (probably inadvertently) support some level of pre-destination, i.e. that AI is inevitable. Also, it raises questions dating back at least Oppenheimer about the culpability of scientists. To quote Jeff Goldblums character in Jurassic Park ""Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."" which more or less summarizes the theme of iHuman and why we should stop and think.I would have liked to hear inside opinions from the big players like Google and Amazon, but ominously they refused to be interviewed.I think the documentary was expertly made with both incredible audio design (think Sci-fi in general, Blade Runner I+II in particular) and visuals. Talking head fatigue is mostly avoided. ***Like I said*** initially, the film clearly has an agenda and the director is using every trick in her impressive arsenal to influence us, the audience. Some of the shots are amazingly beautiful as well. The shot of Juergen Schmidhuber looking out upon creation from his vantage point on top of the Alps is both amusing and has serious historical connotations.PS! About the Schmidhuber scene, a previous reviewer wrote: ""it's just another example of how millenials like this doc maker play with history :-)"". Actually it is not. Firstly, Hessen Schei is most definetely Genaration X (born 1971 according to Google). Secondly, this is something that has nothing to do with generations but rather much more with having a sense of wit and visual humour. There have been plenty of similarly thematically loaded images in docs by Boomers, Xers (my gen) and Millenials.",True
41343,27 February 2020,Jiszmo,Knives Out (2019),10.0,"I just this second finished watching this, and I have to say, 'This is a Great Movie'. It's been ages since I saw a truly great mystery, who dunnit, detective story. I'd say, this is one of the greats films of that genre. It really captures that Poirot (Peter Ustinov) or Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford) type of atmosphere. It has a very similar visual style, as well as, a similar sense of humor. But then amp it up about 50 time (lol). Anyways,this film is basically great.I really liked all the characters. I liked the family and all their interpersonal dramas and bickering. (Once again this reminds me Mrs. Marple or Poirot or Poirot.) It's always good to see Jamie Lee Curtis. She just keeps getting better and better with age. The other actors were unfamiliar to me. But they were all very good.The detective in this one (Detective Benoit Blanc) is also unfamiliar to me. I don't know if this is based on a book or what. Anyways, they should turn this into a franchise. The adventures of Detective Blanc. He is quirky, funny, and all knowing, just ***like those other greats I mentioned*** before. (Though I have to admit I wasn't sure if he knew anything until the very end.)The twists in this. OMG! So many twists' in ways I never expected, or saw coming. This movie does a really good job of amping up the mystery genre. There's even a bit of over the top action. But, it's done really well. Really though, it's the twists, and the mystery, that is tweaked out, and amped up, more than the typical mysteries, of the past.Final Verdict: I strongly recommend it to fans of mysteries, who dunnits, old dark house, etc..",True
41779,27 February 2020,unicornssparkles,Wuthering Heights (2009),2.0,"I was really annoyed about this adaptation for several reasons.Firstly, the overacting. This was most likely down to the (ridiculous) directing, as every character during scenes where there's an argument/tension, just seem to shout and scream with veins popping out of their foreheads, in this really OTT manner, which it was never meant to be like in the book. Yes it was very intense but it was never meant to be in such a melodrama kind of fashion like this. Plus, the other adaptations I've seen, from 1970 and 1992, were not like this at all. The acting and portrayal of characters was just how they should be. The portrayal of these characters was just really off.Something else that really annoyed me was how much of the original dialogue they changed from the original book. Not only that, but the lines the character's had were really stupid, with it being ***like a children's adaptation the way they added really stupid, simplified, basic, unoriginal lines, that were never in Bronte's story AND were just so unnecessary and stupid, instead of just keeping it in the original, creative, complex but exciting literature theme that Bronte wrote*** it in.Oh and those sex scenes, WHAT was the need for that? That was never in the book, and so there was no need to show it, though obviously for the director this was just to add ""passion"" to it or make it seem more exciting and appeal to a younger generation audience. Not to mention the amount of times Cathy and Heathcliff are busy kissing, making it sexual too. They were never meant to kiss that much in the book as well. It was over done and just excessive. Like stop sexualizing and changing Bronte's works like this.It just annoyed me, like why change that much and make it that over the top?!",True

Go find a comic or two and read up on who this anti-hero with the mouth that just won't quit really is. THEN go see the movie and read some of the reviews.Having said that, this actually turned into a Valentine's weekend date for my wife and I. We needed to get out of the house for a bit, and I said that I'd like to go see Deadpool, but I wasn't sure she'd like it. I mentioned it had Ryan Reynolds in it, and showed her the trailer. So SHE said, sure, let's go for it.Note that my wife likes the Marvel comic movies as well as action movies, and language doesn't offend her. We both LOVED the movie - she kept trying to remember all the one-liners from the movie, there were so many of them. Morena Baccarin was perfect as the girlfriend. And when Wade proposed to her with the ring pop - and pulled it from where ... way too funny. Also using the head chopped off from one of the guy's he'd killed AS the weapon to take out another bad guy - and then using it as the dot on the i in Francis ... Yet at the same time, this never really felt like it went too over the top. This was more like how real world people would end up being in a world with super heroes and mutants. Of course, Deadpool breaking the fourth wall all the time was good, too.One thing we discussed afterwards is that the humor was paced out well. You knew you could laugh, and NOT miss something else. Was there a huge amount of violence, with blood and brains splattered? And was there an assortment of nudity? Yeah - you don't go into this movie thinking you're going to see Captain America. This is Deadpool - probably what She-Hulk would be without the comic censor code.Oh, and ***like I said***, my wife and I both loved the movie, and it's one we wouldn't mind seeing again for the action, the humor, and the sheer fun of it. And of course, you do get Stan Lee as well - I think he probably enjoyed this cameo most of all.",True

Which is a really big deal considering the game. Yes, I have read many reviews before writing this one and most of them contains spoilers. Kinda sad considering people read reviews to know about the game playing experience, not to !&%$ing ruin it completely. And it makes me wonder, do these people that wrote negative reviews really had The Witness gaming experience? Or maybe they just got their experience ruined by spoilers themselves... or maybe the game was just not meant to be played and liked by those people?Two things you have to know about this game and this is where every negative review fails: This game is about exploration and puzzle solving. Nothing else really. What did you expect? Also, it does it perfectly. It does it in it's own way. There are similar games out there such as Myst, The Talos Principle and the Portal games, but it's still not even close to what I felt during my playthrough of The Witness. It is an astounding puzzle game where you WILL have your mind blown in many different ways. Keep in mind that this is not your typical video game. It is a puzzle game, and a hard one. You will enjoy progressing if you enjoy learning stuff. It is a very mature game that almost feels ***like working sometimes, but who said*** working has to be boring? Everything, and I mean everything in The Witness is beautiful. Environment, puzzles, design, colors, sound, details, gameplay... Everything is there for you to admire, feel, experience and forget. To make you forget about your life for a moment and completely fill your mind and thoughts with puzzles. But after, when you will go out, you might end up seeing the real world differently, seeing more of it's beauty. That's just what The Witness does.Nothing more has to be said and keep in mind that reading more reviews WILL ruin your experience. The game is all about it. And going in spoilers free is the way to go if you want to live something fun and worthy. The game deserves 9.5/10 but you can't in here so it rounds up to 10.Also, a little bit of precision for some of you that might now know : Jon Blow is the director of The Witness and his last game Braid came out more than 6 years ago. So I want to precise the fact that I did not like Braid that much. I am not a Jon Blow fanboy. I am not brainwashed of any sort. To me The Witness is a masterpiece and a very inspiring game.

42401,12 February 2016,Quinoa1984,Cobain: Montage of Heck (2015),9.0,"I've been an admirer of Brett Morgen's work for a while, and throughout his films (Kid Stays in the Picture, Chicago 10, 06/17/94), he's constantly displayed a great gift for how to do montages and to expand the form of the documentary, whether it's through voice-over that is (and isn't) right out of a book with corresponding imagery for Robert Evans, or with rotoscoped animation for the trial of the Chicago 7 in the late 60's. So it is logical that if he'd take on a documentary on Kurt Cobain it would be in montage form. The question is is it any good? That of course will depend on how attached you might be to the Cobain ""mythos"" that has sprouted since (or even before) his death.I didn't have that kind of attachment - I love the band and ***like his work as a lyricist and musician, but it stops there - so went in to this fairly fresh and only knowing scattered facts about Cobain (all of them petty and none of them really mentioned*** here). What made the movie work for me is that Morgen sets up empathy with his subject and the audience very quickly, and it's thanks to a treasure trove of archive material. This director had access to so much 8mm home movie footage, hand-held camcorder video from the early 90's, old Nirvana band tapes, audio cassette recordings that Kurt made as a teenager, even a couple of voicemail messages and conversations (if the movie doesn't make you want to check out Over the Edge, it's doing something wrong).But most of all are the journal entries, which is where much of the real meat of Morgen's film comes through. You get a complete purview into who Cobain was, from youth up until just near the end, with these journals and they're full of so many words but also drawings - Cobain was an incredible drawer and artist, and maybe in another life could've been a comic book guy with the sensibility of a more deranged Mike Judge or something - so Morgen uses these to his advantage and leaps off from creating animations from these drawings into animations based on Kurt's words. Possibly the highlight of the first half of the movie comes with Cobain's story of being disaffected, smoking pot, and trying to have his first sexual experience with a messed up fat girl, and it's startling to see how these images unfold.But unlike Chicago 10, the movie's not anchored in this style. Morgen is all over the place at times with his montages, going from behind the scenes footage of music videos to Kurt and Courtney's own home movies. The latter becomes borderline invasive in some way, not too far removed from watching the Tommy Lee/Pamela video from years back, minus the sex (though Courtney Love cant help but show some boob). Perhaps it is necessary to see just what their relationship was like without any media bias; this part is also brought forward with articles that I found fascinating for what could very well have been totally true... or a bunch of BS, and probably the truth was in the middle. They were junkies, they were in love, and the degree to how much they were using colors perceptions for people.Oh, and the movie is with wall-to-wall Nirvana music, from very deep, obscure, super-early-career cuts from punk shows to Kurt recording the Beatles 'And I Love Her' on a little cassette. Morgen has a natural ability to combine images with rapid succession, but I never really felt lost so long as I was paying attention to what was going on on screen. I saw it on HBO, but now regret I didn't get the full visual-aural experience in a theater, since it seems made for that kind of maximum impact.I don't even think Montage of Heck gives a 100% clear view of things that happened for Nirvana or in all of Cobain's life, and yet that's kind of fine - it has enough time to go through the major accomplishments, but it doesn't matter the how completely except that he did it, and at that point now what? But by the end of it I felt like I got enough to see the man in a slightly new way. Before my impression of Cobain was of some cooler-than-thou dude who lived the rock and roll lifestyle too fast. In reality, he was a sensitive dude who loved punk rock and skyrocketed much too quickly to fame. Had Nevermind somehow not been so good, one wonder if he'd still be alive - or what else might've taken him down after a childhood of persona non grata status.",True

42619,13 February 2016,ivo-cobra8,High Plains Drifter (1973),10.0,"Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a Clint Eastwood's best pulse-pounding western masterpiece film, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.High Plains Drifter (1973) is in my opinion Clint Eastwood's best pulse-pounding climax classic western masterpiece! It is my fourth favorite Eastwood western film flick and it is in my top 5 Eastwood western films! I love this movie and it is a tone horror dark western movie. Which is the film that I really believe, is a classic Clint Eastwood's best western! This is Clint Eastwood's second film as a director finds the celebrated action star returning to his familiar Old West stomping grounds and his internationally acclaimed role of ""The Man With No Name."" This time, The Stranger (Eastwood) mysteriously appears out of the heat waves of the desert and rides into the lawless, sin-ridden town of Lago. After making a name for himself with a string of blazing gun battles, The Stranger is hired by the townspeople to provide protection from three ruthless gunmen just out of jail. The Stranger quickly proceeds to paint the entire town bright red, rename it ""Hell,"" and supply divine retribution in the fiery, pulse-pounding climax of this acclaimed western shoot-em-up.Plot: A drifter with no name (Clint Eastwood) wanders into a small town, where his gun-slinging abilities are in high demand. When the drifter rides into Lago, he is met with incredulity and disapproval by the townspeople. But once he shows his skills with a pistol, the locals realize he may be able to help them fend off a band of criminals who have been terrorizing the town. He agrees to help the townspeople, but does so with his own secret agenda.""You're going to look pretty silly with that knife sticking out of your ass."" - Best Clint Eastwood's dialogue lines in the film. I like that this film has a good plot, it is mysterious and scary all the time. The three villainies Geoffrey Lewis, Dan Vadis, Anthony James are scary killers in this film, that no one can touches them, and they kill everything that moves. I love how this film is portrayed and that Eastwood is a mysterious stranger on a revenge against the corrupt, selfishness and greed in the town Lago. The movie is evolving about a murder of marshal Jim Duncan (Buddy Van Horn) who was murdered in the town of Lago from three outlaws and the towns people covered up. Clint Eatswood is probably which I assume Jim Duncan's brother that get's revenge on everyone. I have never seen in any movie the town been painted red and written Hell never. Buddy Van Horn been whipped to death by three outlaws. This film is gruesome, bloody and very violent with a gore and tons of shoot-em-up scenes. It is different than For a Few Dollars More but is still pretty good western flick.***Like is said*** I think for a western flick that Clint Eastwood directed is probably his best western movie he directed. I love this movie to death I love it and it is my third Eastwood favorite western film! After he has killed the three men the locals ask if he will stick around and save them from three convicts who are being released after the town got them to commit a rather heinous crime. Seen in flashback scenes the crime is the brutal murder by whipping of a town Marshall. The problem in the film is actually the rape scene, which is tough to watch and the score is a little dated now. The good is not afraid to try something different and raises more questions than it answers. Engaging story, great performances and plenty of violence/action. You have even one explosion in it, the town is burning up in flames and the mysterious man kills all three outlaws on the same way that they killed Jim Duncan. It's not exactly feel good fare ***like I said*** and darker than you'd maybe expect but It's not without a sense of humor and Eastwood expertly directs it, keeping it well paced and relatively short at an hour and 45 minutes long.Overall: I seriously love this film to death! High Plains Drifter is a daring and quite different film with Eastwood not playing a hero type! This film get's a solid 10 by me which everyone of the cast did a solid performance cause I saw the acting been realistic and there are no CGI in this film!

42673,13 February 2016,RealChristian14,"The Flying House: Judgement Day (1982) Season 1, Episode 22",10.0,"Once again,this particular episode of The Flying House present another two parables of Jesus.This time,it offers lessons of what God requires us to concerning others.Interestingly,we get to witness SIR or the Solar Ion Robot to narrate a parable.The first parable told by Angie to the Flying House gang was about a man named Lazarus.There a was rich man in a faraway place who was extremely wealthy.He was eating large amounts of food one day when he saw a beggar named Lazarus,who asked him for food.Unfortunately,the rich man refused.Later,both men died.The rich man was wasting away in hell while Lazarus was spending time with Abraham in heaven.The rich man asked Abraham to be sent back to life to ask his relatives to change so as not to experience hell but was refused.It was explained that there were prophets whom his family should listen to.The second parable was told by SIR.It occurred when the robot and Professor Bumble had an argument.It was about two servants who served a common master.The master left and assigned these each servant a particular part of his house.The servant named Victor was asked to look after the farm while the other named Hector was asked to take care of the mansion.Victor became a helpful to his fellow servants while Hector became abusive.When the master got back,he was pleased with the former and unhappy with the latter.The parables featured today is about what God expects us concerning the treatment of our fellow brethren.The Almighty Lord apparently wants us to be care for our neighbor for what we do to them is also what we do towards Him.The first parable makes us realize to help the least of our brothers particularly the poor.The rich man never did that is why he ended up in hell.Also,it was insinuated that the least people of society have a special place in God that is why Lazarus ended up in heaven.Christians must be involved in charity work and almsgiving.There is nothing more that would please God when we help others particularly the poor.The second parable's message is about caring for others.Just like Victor,he acknowledged that the needs of his fellow servants while being the caretaker of the field just as important as his personal needs unlike his fellow caretaker,Hector.This pleased his master even more upon his return.Just ***like stated*** from the previous paragraph,caring for other people's needs remains a tenet of the Christian religion for it pleases God even more with us.It makes us humble and provides us more happiness in life.",True
42739,13 February 2016,jenlos,Old Fashioned (2014),10.0,"""I don't believe our job is the looking, it's the becoming. Once we are the right person..."" Clay, Old Fashioned. In the world today, so much emphasis is put on what another person can do for us or give to us in a relationship, and not what we can do or give to the other person. We seek romantic relationships to fill a void in our life. But the sad truth is, unless we are whole in ourselves, we will be sorely disappointed when the other person comes up short. None of us are perfect, but if we seek to become who we want to find in another person, that would be a match made in heaven! ***Like Lucky Chucky said***, ""There are no knights in shining armor, but you think you're Cinderella, don't you?"" What a beautiful world it would be where all the ""knights"" were truly knights and all the ""Cinderellas"" were truly Cinderellas. I love that this movie focuses on the journey of becoming a person who is whole, and that we become whole by the grace of God. Everyone makes mistakes, but we don't have to stay there! Clay made mistakes that haunted him, but he was able to move past them and accept God's forgiveness and forgive himself. It's a journey. It's many small steps in the right direction. The biggest truth in this movie, which I shared with my kids, is...""a lot of the boundaries that used to be common, that we've thrown away, were there to protect us. We don't have to go around using each other, hurting each other. It doesn't have to be that way."" This is not unrealistic or impossible. It just takes discipline. And ***like Clay said*** (paraphrased), self-discipline makes for a better character trait in making a marriage work than being experienced in bed. How beautiful it would be to offer ""everything"" to your spouse on your wedding day and not just ""what's left"". I have watched this movie at least 4 times. I get something new out of it every time. As a woman, I think the world needs many more ""Clays"".",True
42748,13 February 2016,kirkendallj-227-156330,Deadpool (2016),9.0,"...but then if you had any clue, you expected that, whether you appreciate the dirty or not. I will not not go so far as to say it is a perfect movie and I don't know why. Somehow I feel Deadpool, if real, would not appreciate it being called a perfect movie. He would care less what I think as long as I shelled out the money to go see it, although I did cheat and went matinée. I asked my son on his birthday LAST YEAR if there was a movie he wanted to go see. He replied,""Deadpool"", which was 4 months later. I am not a geek or a comic book man and most of my Super Hero knowledge comes from TV and movies. Obviously, I had no idea who Deadpool was. I decided to let the movie introduce me to him and whatever my son was telling. Deadpool is a favorite of his. He would rate the movie at 8.5.Fittingly enough,it has B movie feel, but the CGI is top rate. It is easily the perfect format for Deadpool. BTW - don't be late, the opening credits set the tone for the entire movie and perhaps all you need to know about the movie. Everybody is so afraid that Ryan Reynolds would ruin Deadpool like he ruined Green Lantern or like everyone was afraid that Jack Black would ruin King Kong, but as I understand it, Ryan inserted himself into the creative writing process, which made the words his words. Like a song a singer writes, it is always better and Ryan Reynolds was awesome. Morena Baccarin is perfectly in sync with Ryan in a love and romance for the ageless and immature. Her training in Firefly/Serenity as a high price ""escort"" with Nathan Fillion as love interest was very helpful. Ed Skrein is great as the bad guy. This maybe the only drawback. I imagine that it is Dead Pool's style to focus on the problem in front and not go for the bigger boss or the money behind the bad guy. Of course, that is probably in Dead Pool 2.***Like I said*** in the beginning somewhere, they did no wrong, which is helpful when you are telling a lot of jokes. All of them hit at the right time with the right tenor/tone, which is really difficult to keep it fresh and keep it from being a one joke movie, especially when all the material is irreverent.My recommendation is if you want to see a Super Anti-Hero Action Comedy movie, where most of the jokes were created by the cartoonists of Playboy, Penthouse, High Society and so far way down the sewer and approved by Drunk Frat Boys who whose humor never grew age 12(redundant, I know), then you should sell everything you have and sprint to the best theater near you and plan to live there until Deadpool hit Blue Ray.BTW – I called the ending at the end of the credits. On the way, I told my son that what I want to see is (not going to be a spoiler sport) and they did it. My son thinks I am a Super Hero now and true he thinks I am like Gleek from the Wonder Twins than Thor, but I will take it.",True

42755,13 February 2016,StevePulaski,Zoolander 2 (2016),2.0,"It's something of a miracle that the first four mainstream American comedies we've gotten in 2016 have all been noticeably worse than their predecessor. ""Ride Along 2"" looked to be one of my picks for worst films of the year until ""Dirty Grandpa"" came out and distracted me with its relentless display of vulgarian tendencies. The following week, I had to endure ""Fifty Shades of Black,"" a wretchedly unfunny parody of the popular ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" book and movie series. That time around, I was positive that I had seen the worst comedy of the year, but winced at the thought of what I'd have to endure had I been wrong yet again.Right now, I'm not even going to express any kind of sentiment as to what the remaining ten and a half months left of this year may have in store for me, but I do know that I've seen the worst comedy of the year thus far with ""Zoolander No. 2."" Just a sliver away from being as bad as ""Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser,"" another belated sequel to a comedy from 2001 revolving around an insufferable schmo, ""Zoolander No. 2"" is borderline insufferable. With its redundant amount of gags poking fun at excessive social media use, celebrities like Justin Bieber and Willie Nelson that show up in the form of gratuitous cameos, and whatever is relevant in contemporary pop culture, it's like mainstream American comedies now bear the same standards and ambitions as your average Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer project like ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie."" We're basically supposed to laugh at a scene because we recognize the people or the technology it involves rather than the actual punchline? ""Zoolander No. 2"" wasn't made for an analysis even that deep, but I have to leave you, dear reader, with something. The film reacquaints us with the flamboyant, narcissistic fashion model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), who has faded from the public eye and lost all of his cultural relevance since we last saw him (how pleasantly metaphoric). Zoolander is called back into work when Interpol discovers that a slew of pop stars, such as Madonna, Usher, and Bieber, have been assassinated, dying with Zoolander's trademark ""Blue Steel"" look on their faces. Zoolander teams up with Hansel McDonald (Owen Wilson) in order to, once again, infiltrate the world of high fashion in order to get closer to the band of people who are committing these crimes. During this process, Zoolander discovers his rival Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell) has escaped from prison and is also planning revenge on him by way of his estranged son.The film is an exhaustively unfunny stride that lumbers from one poorly conceived setup to the next, mocking Zoolander's narcissism the entire way and Hansel's vanity as if we didn't get enough of these jokes in the first film. The worst possible thing Stiller could've done besides resurrect a character from fifteen years ago that very few even cared to see again on the big screen is rehash the same stale jokes a second time around. Unfortunately, that's precisely what he does with ""Zoolander No. 2."" From the same punchlines to Will Ferrell's utterly incorrigible villain, who we're supposed to laugh at because he looks funny essentially, nothing has changed for Zoolander and his universe despite his audience growing up.The audience who loved the original ""Zoolander,"" and may indeed love this one as well, usually justify or defend their love by claiming that the film is ""just so stupid you have to laugh."" No, I do not. I fail to see the humor in adults acting ***like children, with not a shred of wit to be found in the film's screenplay, and the interesting part about that aforementioned*** justification is that it's the same one used to slam Adam Sandler's recent endeavors (which are no worse than ""Zoolander"" or its sequel). My point is, what do these films have that Sandler's latest films like ""Pixels,"" ""Jack and Jill,"" and ""That's My Boy"" lack? They're both on the same team as far as I'm concerned.The audience of four, including myself, I saw this film with was one of the most drearily silent I've seen in a long time; one walked out and the other two sat frozen in the same position for the entire film. Not a laugh was audible and no one looked to be getting even a microcosm of enjoyment from the desperation on-screen. I know I've used this description before, but must once more because it applies to ""Zoolander No. 2"" ever-so greatly; this is a cinematic endurance test involving a bunch of aging comic performers that are well past their prime in terms of portraying their trademark characters here that are so desperate for laughs and attention that they might as well go straight to being as unsubtle as possible and hold a sign or wear a shirt for the entire course of the picture that reads ""LAUGH AT US"" in big, bold letters.",True

Before I saw this movie, I saw tons of reviews saying that this film was a fun, action packed movie, with great visuals, and a plot that actually wasn't that bad. I see the movie, actually really like it, then when I get home, I get on my computer, and all I can find are reviewers bashing the film. I mean seriously, spill.com gave this a low rental, two some ol' bulls**t, and a f**k you. Richard roper recently said it was the worst movie he had seen all year, despite the fact that he had given the film a D and given at least two other movies a D- and at least one film and F.I won't say the film is perfect, even though I couldn't find any, I'm sure there were at least a few plot holes. Some of the humor didn't work, and it is at least 30 minutes too long.I basically went into this movie expecting great action and effects, and I got that, but there actually were other things I liked in this movie. For example I did laugh quite a bit, some of the humor actually did work for me. And yes, I actually liked the characters. I can't say I really loved any of them, most of them are just forgettable, but Sam Witwicky I did find to be enjoyable. It's weird, I should hate him, but Shia LaBeaof takes a character I should hate and makes him likable, where were you on that one Jeremy Renner.And the plot actually isn't that bad, the last half of the movie is pretty much not stop action. And ***like I said***, I didn't see any plot holes.There are some people who absolutely hate this movie, and to me, they either focus on one negative aspect and exploit it, like Richard Roeper. Or they can't stop living in the 80s, like Spill.com or Brad Jones. I don't really care what Spoony says because I was never really a fan of his. If you do have a strong hatred for this movie, please explain why, what makes this really worse than Season of the Witch, or Battle: LA?

The writing, directing and intense acting is just what spy movies need to be. This is one of the best spy film ever made. I stress when I say One of the best spy films ever made. I am not excluding Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy (mini series turning into a masterpiece film in 2011) or Taken, Nikita, the first two Bourne's, Body of Lies, Ronin etc. Matt Damon has done it again. Played Jason Bourne brilliantly and none else can replace him in my and many other people's eyes. Bourne tries to find the source of his identity and where he came from in this film. This has set the bar to action/thriller genre for years to come and the next one has a lot to live up to. This has everything a Bourne film has. It has one of the best chase scenes in motion picture history, the shaky camera and defiantly, it is not like Bond. People have been arguing (debating) who is better? Who is deadlier? Bond or Bourne and I personally prefer Bourne and the Bourne films but that is not saying that the Bond films are bad. This film has an interesting and intriguing beginning, an epic middle and just a brilliant ending. Don't go to watch this film thinking that it is a Bond want to be or a Michael Bay (he is a good director) trigger happy film. Go to this film and prepare for amazing acting, good directing, the best chasing scenes ever made, remarkable fighting scenes and a climatic ending. ***Like I said***, it is one of the best spy film ever made and I am not even exaggerating, this is one of the best films ever made.

43853,6 September 2011,weathergirl98,Gnomeo & Juliet (2011),8.0,"I must begin by saying that this movie was intended for a younger audience. If you are a Romeo and Juliet fan, but is expecting a mature, more fulfilling movie, just toss this to the side. It is obviously for children, and the producers did an excellent job of performing that task. It has its moments of humor, action, and romance, but still kept it in the criteria of a reliable kids movie. The cast was excellent, and the voices matched the characters perfectly. Although I was shocked at the voice of Ozzy Osbourne as Fawn, I still found the cast reliable and enjoyable. The plot of the original Shakespeare novel was well changed and flipped to match the whole ""gnome"" feature, and the animation and details put into the film were great, even for an animated movie. I gave it an 8, partly because it was, ***like I said***, for children, but also because I enjoyed it! I bought in on DVD the first day it came out, and watch it often. I think that if you at least try and give this movie a chance, pushing aside the negative reviews that weren't quite deserved, you will enjoy it!

44859,4 September 2013,tomsview,Crossfire (1947),8.0,"Many of the characters in ""Crossfire"" speak in a cadence that creates an almost surreal mood. Sam Levine, Paul Kelly and George Cooper all speak as though they are under the control of the same hypnotist. It could just be that the scriptwriter was unable to develop distinctly different characters, but it works well in this film, giving it a quality that has helped secure its place as a classic of film noir.The movie was based on ""The Brick Foxhole"", a novel by Richard Brooks. In the book the victim was black, but for various reasons, the murdered man in the film became a Jew, with anti-Semitism as the theme.Although Richard Brooks didn't write the screenplay, he later became a film director. ***Like John Huston with whom he worked on the script of ""The Killers"", he was a complete storyteller; he wrote*** as well as produced and directed. He made some sharp films: ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""Elmer Gantry"", ""In Cold Blood"" and one I like that many don't, ""Lord Jim"". He was also a tough dude; I once read that he sat Burt Lancaster on his backside after an argument turned physical.The story of ""Crossfire"", which takes place in New York just after World War Two, begins with the murder of a man, Joseph Samuels played by Sam Levene. A pipe-smoking policeman, Captain Finlay, played by Robert Young, investigates the crime. Young's performance is a precursor to the sage characters he later brought to full flower in television's ""Father Knows Best"" and ""Marcus Welby MD"".A number of soldiers were in the murdered man's apartment just prior to his slaying. Robert Ryan gave an acclaimed performance in this film as Montgomery, one of the soldiers in question. Big, sneering and manipulative, he invests the part with a nastiness that is palpable.At first, suspicion falls on another soldier, Mitchell. As part of the investigation, Captain Finlay calls in Sergeant Keeley, Robert Mitchum's character. Keeley tries to protect Mitchell, even arranging for Mitchell's wife to come to town.During a flashback, the film follows Mitchell on the night of the murder where he encounters some unusual characters including Ginny (Gloria Graham), a depressed dancehall ""hostess"". Eventually, he ends up at Ginny's apartment. Here he encounters a man, listed in the end credits as ""The man"", played by Paul Kelly; an unusual performance, his character emerges as forlorn, slightly twisted and possibly dangerous – adding another intriguing layer to this unusual story. The film ends abruptly, and conforms to conventions of the period, which allowed no crime to go unpunished. Montgomery is revealed as the murderer and although unarmed, is shot in the back by Captain Finlay in an almost matter-of-fact manner – showing that codes of conduct can change over 60 years. The budget limitations work in the film's favour with much of the story set at night to disguise the studio sets. The end result was a shadowy, claustrophobic world that was perfect for the telling of its taut tale.",True
44997,5 September 2013,NewOCFan,Boy Meets World (1993–2000),1.0,"Way more than a sitcom. Cory making goofy faces and movements doesn't make it funny. If anything, Eric, Shawn, Feeny and probably even Alan, they're the ones who bring anything amusing into this. There are just not enough words on this site for me to express how I really feel about this show. ***Like I said***, it would've been better as a drama comedy. A single cam show. In the teen drama genre this show would've fit in a lot more. Teen dramas focused on the issues addressed in Boy Meets World AND MORE. Full House and Family Matters (especially the later seasons I think) could be too silly and comical, which is how they can be considered a sitcom. Sitcoms are what people have gone home too from work or school to give you a bunch of laughs like I Love Lucy and Three's Company and even All In the Family. Boy Meets World was just so serious every episode, almost from beginning to end. In the genre where the show actually belonged it would've been the best! Putting that aside, yes the show is good for what it was. It'd get its message across but sometimes the show made the characters looked bad, which contradicts the idea that this show teaches you morals and such. Like Jack Hunter having a moment where he seems to realize greed got the best of him - then goes back to wanting to win the lottery. Amy allowing Morgan to dress sexy for a first date, Morgan being a brat, Topanga showing Cory her butt before they're married, Topanga disobeying her parents to be with Cory, Cory's obsession with Topanga (and there's more I can say about the two from season 4 and up), Shawn's pessimism that never seemed to disappear, some of Eric's choices like poisoning Morgan for his day's birthday, etc. Aside from that, the show didn't even cover everything. Like bullying, suicide, respecting opinions, school shootings, even terrorism which there are two events that are remembered to this day. Besides all of this, it says a lot about the education system and people's parenting skills if people are saying we desperately need this show. Television is not something you allow to raise your kids for you. And from watching classmates around me, I learned no matter what show that teaches kids right and wrong, even if you put a specific episode in front of them, most teens aren't going to listen or realize the message until they've experienced it themselves and realize the teacher or the show are right. People have told me in response to seeing how bad alcoholics can get that it's never going to happen to them which shows no matter how good you write an episode, not everyone is going to go along with the message you're trying to put out until they learn it for themselves. There's things people overlook or ignore that are flaws for this show just because they love it so much. Overall, I can give Boy Meets World at least 3 out of 10 for what it is, if not 5.",True
45032,6 July 2020,filmbuff-05706,Mary Poppins (1964),10.0,"From 1937-1966, Walt Disney made many wonderful movies, from Snow White and Fantasia to Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. Even some live action movies, like Old Yeller, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, The Parent Trap, and Pollyanna still hold places in many of our hearts. But out of all the movies Walt was personally a part of, I believe that Mary Poppins is his greatest single masterpiece.The movie centers on a family named The Banks -and the family is quite broken. The mother is too busy advocating for women's rights to care for the kids, the Dad is a workaholic banker, and the kids always lose their nannies because they get impatient with the kids.Enter Mary Poppins, a magical nanny who helps the kids have fun by taking them on special ""outings"" that result in them being inside chalk pictures and in houses where laughter defies gravity.The father, who is a no-nonsense kind of man, scoffs at the news of such events, but Mary Poppins and her friend Bert help him see that he needs to lighten up and spend time with his kids in order to be a good parent.Mary Poppins was one of the defining movies of my childhood. I saw it numerous times on VHS and it gives me many memories of seeing it as a child. I will give one when I discuss the songs.Even as a teen and then an adult, I found myself seeing it quite a few times. I also bought it on DVD a couple of days before Christmas so I could officially own it.My point is, no matter how old you are, it's a delightful movie. My Grandma even rates it a perfect 10, and she only has about a dozen movies that she would give a 10.There's multiple elements that make the movie so great, even as an adult. One is the acting. The actors don't underact, as some actors do when they are doing a movie aimed at kids, and they do a wonderful job in their parts.Mary Poppins is played by Julie Andrews in one of her most iconic and beloved performances. Like many of Andrew's characters, she is a very proper woman. For example, when the kids are in the air from laughing, she scolds them by scowling: ""Such behavior.""When she first meets Michael, his mouth is gaping at the sight of Mary Poppins sliding UP the banister, and she commands: ""Close your mouth, Michael, we are not a caught fish!"" Her properness and pleasing qualities are what make her such a delight to watch at any given moment.Mary Poppins has a friend named Bert, who is played by Dick Van Dyke in one of HIS best roles. He has a fun and a father-like quality to them(which is kind of ironic) and even though he doesn't have as broad of a role as Mary Poppins, he ends up helping the story resolve.Dick Van Dyke also has another role, one he personally offered to do for free, he was so adamant on playing it. That is Mr. Dawes, Sr., the boss of Mr. Banks. You can tell Van Dyke had fun playing him also.I won't go into all of the parts, but Matthew Garber and Karen Dotrice as the kids, Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson as the parents, and the other parts are all well done. Also look for Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher, and Hermione Baddley in the movie.Mary Poppins also has a neat element in the chalk drawing sequence, and that's the integration of live action and hand drawn animation. This was done by drawing the animated characters on the stills of the camera, according to the making-of segment on my childhood VHS.Even as an adult, it's impressive to see this achieved. Granted, that wasn't new and it would be reproduced, but that doesn't diminish the effect that the segment has.Mary Poppins is also a musical, and it has some of the best ones in all of Disney history. My favorite one is in the animated/live-action segment, and that's Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. (I copied and pasted that, and I won't write it again.) We learn shortly after the song that it's a word to say when you are not sure what to say, and that line plays at a part in the conclusion.That memory I mentioned earlier is that when I was young, I struggled to say that word, and I could only go up to ""supercali-"" before stumbling. It wasn't until I was 11, on New Year's Eve 2009, that I listened to the word closely and finally said the 14 syllable word.Other great songs include A Spoonful of Sugar, Jolly Holiday, I Love To Laugh, Let's Go Fly A Kite, among others. In fact, Chim-Chim Cheree, a song that Bert sings, won Best Song at the Oscars that year. Mention Mary Poppins to anyone and one of these songs are sure to get stuck in their head soon after.As you can see, Mary Poppins has many great elements that makes it such a fantastic movie. If I had to find any fault with it, that would have to be that the 139 minute run-time may too much for some- especially kids, but that personally doesn't bother me.***Like I said***, I have the movie on DVD now, and even as an adult, I will continue to love it and see it from time to time. And whenever I have kids, they'll have the privilege of seeing it as well. Mary Poppins is a movie that all generations deserve to see. Like the nanny herself, Mary Poppins is practically perfect in every way.",True

Okay if you can get over the dodgy looking wigs, bad background music and over-acting in some scenes... and oh the subtitles (I'm not selling this very well am I? Ha ha), you might enjoy this. Be warned, there are 74 episodes to watch, about 45 minutes each!!! So it's not a couple of series with 8 episodes in each like I thought it was going to be but once I started watching I was hooked. I believe there were originally 113 episodes but Netflix cut them down to 74.Based on a true story, it follows the rise and fall of Pablo Escobar from petty crime to becoming Columbia's biggest drug baron. Real footage from news reels are also used but some scenes are played differently to what actually was reported in real life.I also noticed the names of some people were changed, I thought this was because those people were still alive but there are a couple of people who weren't alive at the time of making this series and their names still got changed so I don't know the reasoning behind that.I couldn't binge watch as the series is in Spanish and I had to rely on the English subtitles so I had to really concentrate on what was going on especially when getting very political. The beginning of the series is getting to know the characters. The middle of the series is death and destruction and the last part of the series is well, the national police search for Pablo Escobar closing in on him.***Like I said***, if you don't mind a bit of cheesy watching and subtitles, then you might just enjoy this series.",True
47308,14 December 2008,akeanefan,The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008),8.0,"Once again, Hollywood makes yet another remake of a classic film, and while most attempts at this have been utter disasters, this remake of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" is a rare exception to this rule and deserves far more praise than what is being displayed by the negative reviews here on IMDb. First, the scenario is equally as chilling as the original: Alien visitors arrive to Earth, this time in beautiful, yet ominous looking sphere-shaped spacecraft. The first lands in the middle of central park in New York city and thus begins a very realistic, and intense standoff between humans and the new arrivals. The anticipation was superb and anyone who was not sitting on the edge of their seat during this part was either a.) Stoned b.) Had no pulse or C.) Both. Second, the acting was brilliant, especially on the part of Kuneau Reeves as Klaatu, as well as Jennifer Connely and Kathy Bates. Very convincing performances that truly grabbed the attention of the audience. Finally, the story was a wonderful wake-up call for humanity without being ""preachy"" as some of the negative reviewers complained and you actually walk out of the theater with quite a bit to think about. It's nice to see something from the current world of entertainment that is actually intellectually stimulating, especially from the realm of science fiction. Any director can have aliens blow up the world, but the director of this film blew our minds with a deep and meaningful plot. Also, I would ***like to add that, contrary to what negative reviewers have said***, this film was not Al Gore in a cheap suit and did not contain anything about global warming. This was a fact that I was actually dreading due to the fact that I am sick of hearing global warming being crammed down our throats. I even thought to myself as I walked into the movie theater that if this film even mentions the phrase ""global warming"", then I am prepared to walk out of the theater. Thankfully, however, it didn't and, needless to say, that was a relief. In conclusion I just want to say that while everyone is entitled to their opinion, I also feel that many of the negative reviewers of this film were a bit harsh in their judgments and sometimes I wonder if some of these negative reviewers, who really act like self-proclaimed critics, aren't just like that overweight comic book guy from ""The Simpsons"" with no life and with nothing better to do than to hack to pieces a decent film. No offense intended to anyone, but the vitriol being spewed by some of the negative reviewers really makes me think that the afore mentioned point is the case.Is this film a masterpiece? No. However, it does hold a candle to the original quite well and is definitely worth a viewing.",True

This game is the sensation and almost every boy in South Park play it online just like almost everybody in the South Park office, including Trey Parker! Before watching this episode I only knew one thing: it has a truly great title. And now after watching it I have to say it is a little gem and certainly the great title is just a plus of this that for me is one of the very best from Season 10. This is one of those episodes that just by seeing it for ***like a minute you just totally love it and at the beginning we see the characters in World of Warcraft of Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny and since they play the game online with teamspeak a hilarious thing in this episode is to see the World of Warcraft characters in the middle of something talking about a lot of stuff, like that scene that I mentioned*** with Ike's character or when a World of Warcraft character says something like: ""let's fight because my mom says I have to be in bed before 9"". So if hearing the South Park boys talking is simply hilarious is more when they make talk their World of Warcraft characters. Simply for the look o this episode you should watch it but certainly you will find a lot of great things. Here the issue is that one player's character is killing every other World of Warcraft character so it maybe will be a point in which nobody will want to play the game, the end of the worldof warcraft can be near. Is just great since we see people of the company that developed the game and they are the only ones who can help Cartman, Stan, Kenny and Kyle in order to kill that tough bad-ass's character (the stuff with the sword is fantastic, basically the legendary sword is a USB and the one who told the prophecy is in accounting  this whole stuff is hilarious!). And here the four boys are not cute anymore, they stop doing every other activity for doing the thing that really matters, they have to kill 65,340,285 boars, they will play the game to kill those boars for ""7 weeks, 5 days, 13 hours and 20 minutes, giving ourselves 3 hours a night to sleep""! And when they finally reach the objective of killing boars and of killing that tough bad-ass's character (on the paper was almost impossible since how do you kill somebody who has no life?) is time to finally start playing World of Warcraft! So make love, not warcraft! Since some time I really wanted to watch this episode and now that I both have seen this episode and read the comments by other IMDb users I'm pretty sure anyone who come here looking for recommendations will really want to watch Make Love Not Warcraft since most of the comments here claims that this is the very best episode of South Park or at least one of the very best. While I loved the episode I'm not sure this would be in my top 5 of all time but for sure is one of the very best from Season 10 and is wonderfully unique. 10 out of 10",True
47642,15 December 2008,bwdude,The Day the Earth Stopped (2008 Video),2.0,"Blinded by the (formerly) not so bad rating, I decided to give it a chance.At least it could have been some nice foreplay until ""the one"" with Keanu comes out. (pun intended) But it wasn't.Where do I start ... bad BAD acting of almost everybody in the movie. Especially bad editing, sometimes there are cuts that have absolutely nothing to do with the current scene. Like near the beginning when you hear two people talking and at the same time see shots of people working silently on their computers. And don't get me started on the script.Then there's the ""logic factor"" once again. 666 giant robots are landing on major cities on earth, yet there are NO people on the streets, no hysteria, not even simple curiosity. Everybody is rather calm, like this would happen every day. It's like we (the unfortunate viewers of the movie) get to see them, but nobody else, apart from the principal actors.***Like other people already mentioned***, the superior aliens (in human form) are landing on earth. They have great powers and great knowledge. But a simple sedative knocks them out and an even simpler cell can hold them?In general this *could* have been a nice variation on the original theme, that's why I gave it two instead of one points.It may have been due to budget restrictions, or that they wanted to kick it out before the Keanu-movie. Either way, it did not do it any good.As I said in the title: It's horrible in practically every way, don't waste your time on it.Watch the original or wait for Keanu.",True

I loved Jackass number two, Borat, the Simpsons, hell I even ***like Kevin Smith films!

Never have I heard anyone CLOSE to intelligent say anything positive about it...only an extremely ditsy bimbo of a cheerleader in high school, and 14 year old thought it was funny. I'm not gonna say ""its the worse movie ever"" like so many other morons put, because I have not seen every movie ever made, but I will say it is easily one of the worst films I've ever seen.

47957,16 December 2008,artisticengineer,Slogan (1969),8.0,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS (though I doubt if anybody really cares) This was a nice movie; essentially it shows the love between Serge and Jane. I get the feeling that when it developed, in real life, the director decided to make it the ONLY plot theme instead of the main one. Well, fair enough and when Jane was shown seated, nude, on the bath tub, the last thing I was concerned about was with whatever plot was occurring at that point. In fact, that scene is why I gave the movie an ""8"" instead of a ""6"" or ""7""; which is what it would ordinarily enjoy.Still, once in a while other characters appear and reappear during the movie (other than Serge's wife I mean) and I think they were supposed to represent some sort of plot that was intended, but never shown. There is a scene, early in the movie, where he makes some objects disappear with a snap of his fingers; something that can be done in a TV advertisement easily enough and Serge somehow had this ability in the movie. It was performed once and never again. It is somewhat at variance with the rest of the film, and probably represents a plot line that was never followed up. One thing that hurt the movie (concerning ""suspension of disbelief"") was the idea that Serge would let Jane go; instead of marrying her. What man would actually do that to a 23 year old beauty? It is sorta stretching suspension of disbelief that a man would do so, and, in fact, Serge did not (in real life). One other matter that seems at variance with the primary idea of the movie is the wife that Serge leaves for ""his homebreaker""; as he describes Jane Birkin. The wife is actually a very attractive woman and Serge should have shown more conflict about leaving her for the equally attractive, but younger, woman.***Like I said***, in real life a romance developed between Serge and Jane during the filming so I presume the director decided to concentrate on that; even at the expense of the believability of the movie. Can't blame him; it actually makes the movie even more entertaining.",True
47971,16 December 2008,Heath618,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007),9.0,"I would ***like to reiterate every single word that Kingtrio9 said*** in her review. Best acting yet. The movies, like the books, grow and mature as their characters do. Single complaint--the soundtrack. Nicholas Hooper fails to provide much of a canvas for the movie to play out on. Sometimes the moments of silence are fitting and dramatic, but they happen too often. The Harry Potter theme, John William's ""Hedwig's Theme"" is played only 2 or 3 times in the movie and it is never the original--it is a Hooper adaption. Most of the background music sounds like mischievous tinkering. It doesn't do justice to any Harry Potter movie, but ESPECIALLY one as serious as this.He fails to capture the pure magic orchestrated by John Williams in the first two films and the medieval mystery he wove into the third, as well as the dramatic, sweeping, epic feel provided by Patrick Doyle in The Goblet of Fire. One exception--the end scene in the Department of Mysteries; there I must say, ""well done.""Let's hope he gets a bit more creative for the next films!",True

48275,5 May 2020,kjproulx,Upload (2020– ),9.0,"It's been a while since I've come across a new television show that felt as unique as Upload. With all of the content out there these days, it's hard to find something that's incredibly original, and while this series may borrow elements of things you've seen before, I found it to be very fresh. Amazon Studios, between feature films and television series', has been knocking it out of the park for years now and I believe this series deserves some recognition as one of their best. Here's why I believe the first season of Upload is worth your time.In a world that's probably much like our own in many years to come, it's overrun by technology and people are given the choice of either a normal death or paying to upload their consciousness into a digital world of their choosing. Run by corporations that take care of their own individuals, it can become quite personal. After Nathan Brown (Robbie Amell) parishes in a car accident, he goes quickly chooses to be uploaded before his death. Falling for the woman controlling his body in this digital world and learning secrets about his own past along the way, this simple story ends having many interesting layers. If for nothing else, this series is very engaging on a story level.By the time this season had concluded, I was eager to continue, so if that's not enough reason to recommend it, then let's dive into some specifics. From the very moment that Nathan arrives in this new world, the cleverness begins to leap off the screen. From opening a fridge and swiping for more options ***like a cell phone to certain characters clearly being internet hackers, and even the way this world runs based on gigabytes and how much people can afford, I ended up losing track of the number of times I said***, ""Oh, I see what you did there."" The premise of this series is very unique as I said, but the fact that so much care was put into the subtle humour that not everyone will get, kind of shocked me, in a good way.I'll admit, from his performances on shows like The Flash or in movies like The Duff, I never thought that Robbie Amell could lead his own film, let alone a great series, but I was wrong. While I don't think his performance is award-worthy or anything like that, I absolutely believed that he was this character. He carries this series on his shoulders and this is easily the best performance I've ever seen him give. He, along with a really solid performance by Nora Antony, shared some great chemistry and if that aspect didn't work for me, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this show overall.In the end, Upload is a simple futuristic story that feels unique and is elevated even further by nice twists, clever humour, and world-building. I will absolutely be returning for a second season, which I really hope gets made. Luke was also a funny secondary character that earned his presence to me, even though I can see how some viewers may find him slightly redundant or annoying. There is a lot to like here, especially if you're looking for an original concept to dig your teeth into. I recommend checking out the first season of Upload, now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.",True
48284,5 May 2020,danielmanson,Extraction (2020),8.0,"I'll start by saying I massively enjoyed this. It's an all out action film with some absolutely brilliant action scenes, the long takes worked so well and was really good to watch. The reason why I enjoyed it is because it's an almost mindless action plot where there's car chases, guns, fighting, explosions and more guns. Sometimes people just need a release and watch some simple good action and this is it.Linking to what I just said, the plot. So, it doesn't go into any kind of depth into the villain whatsoever, it was just this is who he is, deal with it. Why did he have all this power? He just needed depth. He was also barely in it. ***Like I said*** before it didn't bother me at all, but I can see why that would fuss a lot of others.

48536,5 May 2020,Horst_In_Translation,Suchkind 312 (2007 TV Movie),2.0,"""Suchkind 312"" is a German television film from 2007. This is another version of a movie that was made in the 1950s already, so really during the time it is set, and it is based on a book. Well, I guess the good nes is that pretty much everybody who was part of the 50s movie in one way or another was dead by 2007 and the original writer wwas not alive anymore either, so they did not have to witness what a horrible outcome we have here. I have not seen the old version (yet), but there is no way it could be worse than this new adaptation. It is just a mess from beginning to end. Now you probably wonder why I say that you should watch this film in the title of my review, bit in the exact same title you also have the answer. It is the most unintentionally funny film I have seen in a long time. There are so many moments and segments and scenes that were supposed to be highly dramatic, but it is really hilarious how the complete absence of not just talent, but effort as well, make this a true guilty pleasure. I will elaborate on some of the scenes I am talking about soon, but let's stay with the basics first. The director is Gabi Kubach and there is not much to say about her. She has worked on several films that were rarely even mediocre, so the outcome here is not a surprise. Admittedly she is not as much to blame as the two writers, who were not exactly experienced when they made this film, but had worked on other stuff together already. So they were a team, that much is safe. And they also hit rock bottom as a team here. The writing is an insult really. And they got the one actress here in Germany, maybe on the planet even, who effortlessly turned said incult into a true abomination because she is even less talented than Beck and Eifler, the writing duo. I am of course speaking of Christine Neubauer, the actress who always managed to turn every film she is in into utter failure due to her complete lack of talent, range and versatility. She makes up for all this by going full ham every single scene and as the writers were ""smart"" ennough to turn almost every scene into an emotional rollercoaster for the female protagonist, this film is something you will maybe never see again looking at how extremely horrible it is, but also how extremely funny it is at the same time.I am honestly trying to forget these 1.5 hours as quickly as possible, but I will still mention a few examples. First of all, there is no way she could 100% say that the girl on the photo is her daughter. But of course, she is such a caring and smart mother that she knows immediately and of course she is right. As always with Neubauer in her movies, we are supposed to like her and feel for her. Embarrassing stuff really. And as if this wasn't bad enough already, the girl's father at the exact same time recognizes the girl as her daughter too. By the way, the girl and the father were thought to be dead by Neubauer's character. Another truly realistic coincidence we have here. Actually two major coincidences. Okay, you already guess what happens next. Neubauer's character has to fight throughout the movie to be allowed to have contact with her daughter. Just out of nowhere, another woman shows up and she says that it is actually her daughter. More fake drama. Hilarious stuff really. Also how the daughter at the orphanage is told that everybody else has no parents either. And she gets 2 (almost 3) out of nowhere. And the daughter knows of course at least one parent is still alive because she feels it. Hey, she has Neubauer's character's genes right? Everything is possible. Anyway, more failure from Neubauer: The flashback sequences in the first half. The emotional scenes when we see Neubauer's character lose her daughter on the train back then were just an abomination. Those weren't funny either. Just really an insult to everybody who really lost a child or a parent during these critical days of WWII. But what was funny because it really lacked any effort were the following less serious flashback scenes that are about Neubauer's character meeting the daughter's father. She is supposed to be 10 years younger in these scenes. Guess what? She looks exactly the same as she does in the now. But maybe you did not recognize how much the make-up and costume department sucked here as well if you only paid attention to Neubauer's abysmal line delivery while she is narrating during these flashback sequences. Okay, more nonsense: The moment her husband finds out about the other child is also the moment when Neubauer's character is finally found by her ""true love"". Exactly this moment. When she tells her spouse that the other man is dead. Boom. He shows up at the door. And he brought flowers too. By the way, where was he when the husband says goodbye to the business partner. Anyway, this scene I just mentioned also results in neubauer's character falling to the ground. She does so a lot during this movie actually. Also if you take a look at the stairs scene towards the end almost. I will not lie. I wanted the character to die during this scene. Of course she doesn't though. I mean Neubauer is chubby enough to soft-land. Oops am I allowed to say that? I mean Neubauer has made a career of many years, decades actually, built on the idea that the fact that she is not as thin as most others and nothing else tricked millions of people into thinking she as attractive and she has acting talent. I mean the former is up to discussion. I personally don't think so at all, but the latter is really so obvious that everybody who thinks this lady can act must be suffering from serious issues. As for the looks, people just tend to believe something when they see and hear it often enough and of course Neubauer's characters in all her movies have relationships with fairly attractive men, often much younger than herself. The art of make-believe. Just tell a lie a 100 times and eventually people will accept it as truth. Also Neubauer was how old back in 2007? 45? Approximately. And yet we are supposed that her husband wants to make another child with her. It's the 1950s... That scene when she just wanted to tell him something and she (like a boss, oh what a self-confident woman she is!) orders the maid to stay outside because there was something completely different on her mind than intercourse.There were really so many horrible moments in this movie that I can't mention them all (also the near car accident e.g) within the character limit. But I will give you some more. The ending is the best example too. Of course, it is 100% happy. The husband realizes he lost because his (ex-)wife is such a strong woman and mother with deep feelings for both her children that he let her get away with it. It makes no sense to everything he did before. Also cringeworthy how they were building him up as the main antagonist. They really used the cheapest tricks there. Just take the incredibly cheesy schmaltzy quote between her and her lover that life makes no sense if he does not return from war. This quote is referenced several times, but I was already ready to throw up the first time I heard it. But back to the husband: Let's be neutral for once. His wife does not tell him she has/had another child. Nice. After he finds out eventually because she has to tell him and even says to her that he will stay with her, which definitely is not to be taken for granted during that time, he tells her that he wants no more lies. Guess what. At that point, she already knew her lover, the father of the girl, was still alive. Does she tell him? Nope. Took her long for the next lie, didn't it? At least she goes and confesses it all to her friend immediately after. And when it comes out, then she still has the audacity to go up the stairs to her son's room and say that he will take him with her. After all these lies, secrets and games she has been playing. What a likable woman/mother. Simply disgusting. I really felt bad for the father all the time. Of course, there were also scenes away from neubauer's character that were pretty poor. Just take the fight between the two men and of course the girl's father wins it. The career ambitions of the husband are also depicted in the most shallow manner. And with that I do not mean his priorities, but what the writers came up with. Speaking of the husband, there is also one moment, really brief, but that is truly a travesty, namely when the character says something about a dime novel or penny dreadful as the Brits say. What a joke. This entire movie is a dime novel. How dare they act as if something else sucks when they suck from minute one until the very last shot! Admittedly, maybe not until the very last shot. This scene when she smiles, but she is not smiling at her husband, but at her lover and daughter was not as bad as everything else in this movie. But it is definitely not worth sitting through the 85 minutes before that, especially if we once more have to look at these men who really adore and love Neubauer's character because of what an amazing woman she is. Ridiculous honestly. This film is a slap in the faces of all those people who really suffered during wartime and also when the war was over. ***Like I said***, most of them are already gone and may they rest in peace instead of being confronted with the movie equivalent of dime novels (not a statement on the actual book this is based on, just what they made of it). So even if this film was so bad it was funny already on many occasions, I have to correct my statement from the title of this review and I definitely say: Do not watch at all! I can't use swear words here because otherwise my review wont get accepted. So I express myself the appropriate way.

Moreover, while Conan does occasionally come across ***like a prickly and petulant perfectionist jerk, one does get a strong impression of Conan as not just a guy with a deep-seated need to be in front of an audience who loves what he does, but also as a basically decent and hardworking fellow who truly cares about and appreciates his fans and makes it a point to give said*** fans the best possible show that he can regardless of the circumstances. Of course, Conan is frequently quite funny throughout, plus he sings well and plays a nice guitar.

Honest film-making and unmistakable.This film is somewhat different from the others on his filmography. In many ways, the camera is closer, and for some reason I felt the Hong Sang-Soo I found on his first film, ""The Day a Pig Fell Into the Well"" (1996), in many ways the style is similar, but of course, with more experience and awareness. Grass (2017) seemed like the zenith of a certain period, major work on synthesis, if we can compare films, Grass was the sum of 20 years of film-making in a certain style.
But ***like I said***, this film is different, it looks like he restarted in a certain way, like every brave artist does from time to time.The story takes place in a Hotel near river where a father (a famous) writer receives his sons and then there is another story about a woman, who was left by her partner for another woman, that spends time in another apartment with her friend.
I don't want to spoil anything, but the major theme seemed to be about love, the necessity, to be love, to be loved and how people strive so much to cope with their notion of love, how it affects them, what makes them do, etc...Every human being wants to be loved, this is what I felt in the end.

It depicts a child who has been abandoned, by her mother and then grandmother and later partly by her foster-mother, so she feels she can not depend on adults for security. It also shows the value of family and love and affection within the family. Unlike American movies where no one seems to have a family, where the only expression of love is trivial and sexual, here the emotions are deep and adult.The movie elevates us to our higher beings, and that is why the experience is lasting, and enjoyable.What I also liked about this movie is that the movie is pure and clean, and suitable for families again unlike American shows where there is always some agenda from some interest group.

51185,14 February 2016,Reno-Rangan,Sicario (2015),9.0,"This was really a great film. Fighting against the drug trafficking was the theme. The story of an FBI agent who was recruited to work in an elite force that no one knows its existence. Their's aim is to tackle the main source, instead to deal with its lower order. Something that impossible to do without international cooperation. Every raid is done in secretively, sometime if required at any cost in whatever effort to stop it. ***Like I said***, this was an awesome movie, and good to see it after the documentary like 'Cartel Land'.The story is kind of hard to detail it out, because it was more an action movie than the talking. How a special force unit goes after the bad guys and stops them is the main plot. But the characters were so distinctive, every main roles had their own agenda for what they are doing and that's how the narration dominated with the high standards.The cast who played them were simply outstanding, including that starts with Emily Blunt, who is someone looks changed the attitude to play physically challenging roles after 'Edge of Tomorrow'. And then Josh Brolin and another one, an upcoming young British actor who I really don't know, but Benicio Del Toro was actually the show stealer.His part was unexpectedly great, totally raw and aggressive. Especially the his end scene, no one could have guessed it, but that's how the way it is. No doubt any top actors would have denied to perform that, anyway well shot with minimum violence, but the intention was very clear as fighting against the dark forces to cut off the head first.

51754,15 February 2016,peterp-450-298716,Mercury Plains (2016),3.0,"Every descendant of a famous person struggles with the same problems. They all have to prove themselves real hard, so they aren't referred to as ""son of"" or ""daughter of"". The prejudices that everything is served on a silver platter for them and thanks to their famous father and mother the path to success is without obstacles, is difficult to avoid. I guess Scott Eastwood (indeed ""son of"") knows what I mean. If you take a look at his his filmography, Scott has been really active. Although most films sound unfamiliar to me (except ""Diablo"" which, however, I gave up watching after 10 minutes due to the old-fashioned look and the fact that I'm not really a western fan), he also succeeded in getting a part in ""Suicide squad"". A movie I'm eagerly looking forward to. Time to see whether Scott can shake off the image of his über cool father.""Mercury Plains"" should have gotten the alternative title ""Goonies meet Sicario"". Because in essence this is just a film about a gang of scouts members (looks like it in a way) who are led by an (allegedly) charismatic, articulate leader to fight against drug gangs in Mexico. After witnessing some amateurish-looking skirmishes with local drug dealers and a raid by the police, the story evolves into a kind of survival trip in the desert. A bit like ""Beyond the reach"". It's situated at the Mexican border near notorious Mexican cities such as El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. Scott Eastwood plays the unemployed, American teenager Mitch. He's convinced by a friend to cross the border of Mexico. Thanks to his friend, Scott gets in trouble and is approached by Jesse (Justin Park) who tells him about The Captain (Nick Chinlund).I tried to be unbiased and gave Scott a chance to prove himself. But I couldn't resist to compare him with his father. And the similarities are creepy anyway. It was as if I was looking at the young Clint again. The same facial structure and profile. The same calm and controlled expression. Also a man without many words and thoughtfully taking every possible option into consideration. Even the intonation of his voice and the controlled manner of answers are similar. Without any doubt Scott's future looks bright. As long as the future films he's going to play in, are from a higher level. Because in general you can say that this was an abominable bad movie, full of improbabilities and ridiculous situations.Scott's acting was by far the best that you could admire in this movie. That's not so hard since the rest of the cast just made a mess out of it. Maybe the age caused it. But sadly enough Chinlund wasn't too convincing either. And Angela Sarafyan looked desirable, but her part was meaningless and pathetic. Furthermore, I was wondering the whole movie if Mitch's step father actually wasn't worrying about his missing SUV. Most laughable fragment was a confrontation with a known drug dealer. As told by The Captain he seemed to be guarded heavily. But I never saw a dangerous drug dealer being overpowered this easy. The guerrilla operations carried out by this group of young people against seasoned drug cartels, resembled those of old B-movies. The denouement in the sweltering desert looked considerably better, but by that time I already fought against the urge to stop watching. Hopefully Scott Eastwood goes his own way and will be offered a part in a decent film. ***Like the old Eastwood once said***: ""Improvise, Adapt and Overcome"".More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",True

There was nothing here; nothing original, nothing special, nothing scary, nothing worth watching.When Sarah (Niamh Algar) and Mark (Stephen Cromwell) escape to the Irish countryside for some alone time they find themselves stuck on an isolated property hiding from some creature. The movie makers tried to drum up some fear and suspense but it fell flat. How can I even be expected to fear a creature that spends most of its time unnecessarily stalking its victim? I know that was done for added fright, but it only made the creature more baffling as it could only hunt during the night so time was precious. This creature timidly slinked around in order to give us a 90 minute movie as the heroine fought it off with flashlights, cell phone light and matches. There were definitely several points in the movie when I wondered what's the plan. Not just the plan of the protagonist but also the plan of the creature. Both of them seemed aimless. What I watched was a choreographed hunt where they both strategically harmed each other a bit until one of them delivered the kill shot. ***Like I said***, there's nothing to see here folks.",True

Behemoth is not down there with SyFy's worst, not with Quantum Apocalypse, Alien vs. Hunter, Dinocroc vs. Supergator, Moby Dick: 2010 and Titanic II.What does salvage the movie from being bottom-of-the-barrel quality ***like the aforementioned*** titles are the surprisingly good CGI effects, when I finally saw the monster fully I was surprised at how good it looked compared to other effects I've seen on the channel. Also William B. Davis while not outstanding gives a noteworthy performance.Everything else didn't engage sadly. The settings were okay, but the haphazard editing and rather dim lighting prevented me from properly enjoying. The story is rather plodding, very predictable and by-the-numbers, with any thrills, suspense and tension feeling somewhat tame and only the ending properly exciting.The script is banal and as plodding as the story. The beginning especially is full of overlong and sometimes meaningless exposition. The direction is often unfocused too, the sound is lacking in clarity even in crucial scenes and the music to me was forgettable at best.The characters are lifeless, clichéd and none of the characters emotionally resonated with me in any way. This is not just the script and expositions, but the dull acting also plays a major factor in this. Davis as far as I was concerned was the only one who tried, everyone looked bored and were phoning in.Overall, SyFy has done worse but I don't recommend Behemoth. 3/10 Bethany Cox",True
52228,7 September 2011,tonysdoctor,Hardcore Pawn (2009–2015),1.0,"I first seen this show on TruTV one night flipping channels with my husband. We watched it thinking it was something along the lines of Pawn Stars, and we were very disappointed.One can easily sit here and trash this show by comparing it to another great show but I am going to give it an honest review without comparing it to Pawn Stars through out everything wrong with the show.Hardcore Pawn takes place in Detroit, where everyone comes to pawn their stuff for cash. We see the store, and it's fairly decent, and by the size you can tell it has had success, which brings up my first point of problem. It is family owned.Les GOLD (No joke, that's his name) owns the pawn shop, manages it and then has his kids in charge of it, which are Seth and Ashley. Neither of them are likable, bringing up a hard time watching this show.As people bring in the more expensive things to pawn off, Les and his son Seth always go for the LOWEST PRICE and successfully rip people off. In one episode a man brought a deck of military and navy playing cards printed in 1899. The cards easily were worth a few hundred bucks, and had an official certificate of proof. They also had never been opened, sealed in the case. Instead of trying to give this guy at least $100 for something that is over a hundred years old and very valuable, Seth offers 20 dollars, 20 DOLLARS for something that has been sealed for a hundred dollars! The guy eventually settled for 30 bucks, and got ripped off. This is just an example of how the Gold family belittles people and rips them off every way possible on this show.Next is Ashley, Les' daughter. While the son is probably the worst of them for ripping customers off so bad, Ashley has a reputation only for her mouth. It's hard watching this show because of her constantly shooting her mouth off and it makes one wonder; why is she in charge? Oh she's his daughter, that's right. When Ashley starts screaming and cussing in front of the customers (And do note how the camera's focus on the customers turning their heads to look) all it does is make the store look bad. Her father don't care, and while he complains and moans on camera about her, he does nothing to resolve the issue of her constantly arguing with the employees.In contrast I will not say this show is staged ***like some people have mentioned***. I do believe it could be real, but it is extremely exaggerated. As other reviews suggest, every episode has some drama and tension from at least one bad apple customers that threatens violence, or like usual; they make a big scene in the store by yelling cussing and screaming threatening to beat someone up. This makes it boring very fast, especially when it's every episode.Before watching this show, do not compare it to Pawn Stars. What you're getting is the complete opposite. While Pawn Stars is more of unique items that have a real history and value, they also try to give people their money for things. I'm sure if someone brought in a deck of military playing cards from 1899 on Pawn Stars, they would have at the lowest offered a hundred dollars and tried to make a deal, unlike Seth on Hardcore Pawn that wanted to go to 20 dollars.",True
53261,5 September 2013,Bambifan101-4,Robot and Monster (2012–2015),1.0,"This show is stupid and boring. It obviously tries to have good qualities, such as messages about friendship, but it's all overshadowed by the overall extreme stupidity of the show. The premise itself is a very dumb idea. Monster is also a VERY annoying and obnoxious character. The show in general has really poor animation and terrible voice acting. It's also very cliché and has a very juvenile sense of humor. Whoopee cushions for example. Other examples of crudeness include vomiting and poop. The show is much less disgusting than Sanjay and Craig, but still very bad. I'd recommend Gordy instead of this show. It also has an unlikely friendship, but is much less juvenile and not obnoxious. One last thing I don't get. Why am I the only person on IMDb who has admitted the TRUTH about this show? No one else who commented here has admitted that's it's a very bad and boring show like they should have. Although, I'll admit, it only has 5 reviews total anyway, but really people. Do you really think THIS is a quality show? I don't. And, although the main review at Common Sense Media praises it, the users all say the same thing I've always thought about it. This happened with T.U.F.F. Puppy too, only it was the opposite. And in case you haven't noticed, this show's praise is actually very infuriating to me. But, ***like I said***, I DO admit this show is not as bad as Sanjay and Craig. And even THOSE SHOWS are better than Fred. And at least Robot and Monster hasn't become an overrated Internet meme like Fred, even though Fred got a 2.1 (I say it should be negative infinity and beyond!) It's because of that I am not using lots of exclamation marks and whatnot like I did for many of my other reviews. But honestly, I don't care for this show at all. Not at all. It's so boring and lame. And ***like I said***, at Common Sense Media, the users actually reverse what the main review thinks is or is not a quality show. Even though the main review for Robot and Monster rated it with 4/5 meaning really good and T.U.F.F. Puppy with 2/5 meaning disappointing, the users do the opposite. I agree with those users 100%. This show is not only really bad and boring, but also completely ridiculous and moronic. No wonder it got canceled already without even finishing its first and last season! And that's all I have to say about it. Thank you for reading.UPDATE ON FEBRUARY 7: I just watched the first episode of Nick's latest monstrosity Breadwinners. It's just as bad as this show! To Dreadnought Dreadnought, can you review it please once it officially airs? Also, you forgot to mention Sanjay and Craig (or have you not seen it?) And yes, I've noticed the ratings manipulation, it's on every new Nick show, yes, even Marvin Marvin. And I just KNOW it's going to be on Breadwinners too.UPDATE ON FEBRUARY 14: So far Breadwinners is rated with 4/10. GREAT! I knew no one would like it. Or almost no one.

I gave the reboot a shot and didn't care for it but this one had Benedict Cumberbatch playing the villain all Trekkies will tell you is the greatest bad guy in existence (and I'll be honest, I don't understand why) so I gave the film a shot and I loved it! The story is decent, the action is fist-pumpingly awesome and the special effects will make your eyes bleed rainbows because they are so stellar. The film did, however, have some issues. There's plot holes that will drive the pretentious viewer and Trek purist insane with anger and the cast of characters felt way too big for me as most of the characters end up being haphazardly placed in the story and feeling completely out of place ***like the writers quickly wrote*** scenes for them so they don't go to waste.However, the complaints are minor in my opinion as the film is fun to watch and just plain exciting thanks to its action and Benedict Cumberbatch making a villain I once held firm was all hype and his lameness being painfully obvious and watching him turn that character into something cold, calculating and cool.

53771,6 September 2013,Bambifan101-4,Gordy (1994),10.0,"The talking pig who made it big has got people here folks! He's just your average adorable little piglet, from a typical farm family. That is, until his family has been taken away! Now he's off on an epic search in the city to find them! Along the way, he makes friends with two kids, and saves one of them from drowning! Gordy becomes famous for his actions of heroism, and becomes the CEO of a business! Eventually, with all the fame Gordy has attracted, he gets his own stamp! Meanwhile, an unscrupulous business man tries to take on Gordy and get rid of him! His henchman are told to kidnap him, tie him in a sack, and toss him in the river! But with the help of his new friends, they all figure out where his family's been taken to (a slaughterhouse in Omaha). They go there and successfully shut the sinister slaughterhouse down once and for all! And in the end, Gordy and his friends and family all get to live together on the farm forever! This seems to be a love-it or hate-it type movie. But I loved it! A sweet story, cute characters, and a precious piglet! This is the most underrated movie ever! It's beautiful and proves that no matter how small you may be, you can always make a difference! And it's NOT a rip-off of Babe. They are just as good and just happen to share some similarities.UPDATE ON September 17: Actually, Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale is not a hobo's version of Gordy. It is an in name only mockbuster of Charlotte's Web which just so happened to be released three weeks and three days before the live-action version came out. So, what did they do? That's right, they copied the original animated masterpiece from 1973. Very loosely that is. Hence it's an in name only mockbuster. Also, I never knew South Park ripped off Gordy. And I already hate that show just like you do, for pretty much the same reasons. Look at my list entitled ""The most overrated shows and movies ever"" and you'll see my reasons why. And as far as I'm concerned, the real reason Gordy's a great gem of a movie is not because it's funny (although that contributes). No, the real reason it's wonderful is because of its heartwarming story (which is NOT charmless, it's adorable), its lovable characters (come on, you know Gordy's adorable), its wonderful moral messages (I've already touched on this in this review and the one on my other account), and it's just plain entertaining, wholesome family fun. I know a lot of people say it's too dark with the slaughterhouse, but what about Bambi? Or The Lion King? They both feature the death of the most important parent (in Bambi it's the mother, in Lion King it's Simba's father Mufasa). At least Gordy's parents don't die. This is actually one of the few Disney movies where the parents live. Which makes it a lot like Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan, Tangled, and Mulan. Also, Sleeping Beauty was dark too. And then there's people think this is rip-off of Babe, um, no it's not. Babe's not about a pig having to save his family, Gordy's not about a pig aspiring to become a sheepdog. They're different plots people! Plus Sleeping Beauty was A LOT ***like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, does that make it a rip-off too? And I already mentioned*** one reason why Lion King and Bambi are alike, but there's more. They both have the Circle of Life theme, they both have the protagonist as next in-line for the throne, they both have the antagonist kill the important parent, there's a fire in both movies, the hyenas assist Scar the same way Man is assisted by hunting dogs, they both have the protagonist fall in love with his childhood best friend, they both have epic battles (like when Scar fights Simba and Bambi fights Ronno), and they even both have the book ends trope! So yeah, you see what I mean? And yet NO ONE has accused Lion King as being a Bambi rip-off. Not that that's what I'm saying, but I'm saying they're more similar plot-wise than this is to Babe. And come on, even shows like Shake it Up and Dog with a Blog have higher ratings than Gordy. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER! I already wrote a review of Dog with a Blog explaining why it's awful and SHOULD have been canceled after the first season like Marvin Marvin.

53942,7 September 2013,moviexclusive,The Bling Ring (2013),8.0,"Since her debut film ""The Virgin Suicides"", and through ""Lost in Translation"", ""Marie Antoniette"" and ""Somewhere"", Sofia Coppola has been a divisive filmmaker lauded by some for her stylish dreamy mood pieces and criticised by others for being shallow and superficial. Her fifth feature, loosely based on real-life events that took place in 2008 and 2009 which was the subject of Nancy Jo Sales' Vanity Fair article, is no different - while some may find it luridly compelling, others will no doubt call it vapid.Yet in this case, we are inclined to see it as a perfect example of how art imitates life - how else will you describe the group of Southern California teenagers - four girls and a boy - who broke into the homes of Hollywood celebrities like Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Audrina Patridge and Rachel Bilson and made off with over $2mil worth of dresses, shoes, watches, sunglasses and even underwear? Can you blame them though? After all, wouldn't it be logical to assume that they would crave exactly what defines the celebrity-worshipping, materialistic culture they were born and bred into?But their sociopathy extends far beyond their yearning for designer swag - ""let's go shopping!"" says one of the teen girls before breaking in and helping herself to whatever catches her eye, revealing nary a hint of compunction. Such is the psyche of these dysfunctional kids, who assume it's OK to steal from the rich and wear their spoils around town, even boasting about their exploits ever so casually to their schoolmates and friends. Even more baffling is how they seek to justify their behaviour in post-trial interviews to a Sales-like reporter - all but one so conveniently blame either the environment or their peers, pulling the sympathy card to deflect responsibility for their actions.Indeed, it might certainly be tempting to frame their story as either satire or critique, but Coppola avoids any hint of irony or outrage in her telling. Rather, she observes their actions, words and thoughts with cool detachment, casting no judgment upon her characters even though that may seem the easy or logical thing to do. Coppola's filmmaking is also admirably attentive to the details of their lives - including Nicki (Emma Watson) and adopted sister Sam's (Taissa Farmiga) home-schooling by the former's mother (Leslie Mann), shy new kid Mark's (Israel Broussard) desire for acceptance from the exciting and beautiful Rebecca (Katie Chang), and most significantly the innate fear and hunger in every teenager to stand out from their peers.Trusting her audience to make up their minds on their own, she offers more than enough for one to discern her characters' lack of conscience and consciousness at what they are doing. Yes, one reason why these sociopaths prove so bewitching to watch is their utter naivety - not only do they take no precautions by wearing any face masks or gloves, their post-spree ritual consists of heading off to some expensive nightclub with their stolen 'bling' on and around them and posting tons of photos on Facebook and Twitter.Careful also never to revel or endorse the sort of lifestyle they represent, Coppola however aims to evoke an aesthetic in her filming which epitomises that which her characters seek for in their nocturnal pursuits - in particular, a near-wordless scene filmed by the late cinematographer Harris Savides has us watching from a distance while Rebecca and Mark burglar a hillside home set against the Los Angeles Basin, projecting a sensual attraction much like a bejewelled palace that her protagonists must have felt. There will certainly be those who disagree, but Coppola's style ultimately makes them teenagers more relatable - precisely because we realise for ourselves how easily it is to get caught up in the pursuit for beauty and fame.That visual panache isn't all the movie has going for it; Coppola also gets sterling performances from her teenage cast. All eyes will likely be on Emma Watson, who post-Hermoine proves that she can as easily slip into another decisively different role which requires her to be the exact opposite of who she was in 'Harry Potter'. But we surmise that the real standout here will be Katie Chang - arguably the ringleader of the group and perhaps the most brazen of the lot - and with poise and beauty, it's mesmering to see how she manipulates Mark to do her bidding.***Like we said*** at the start, 'The Bling Ring' will certainly be as divisive as the rest of Coppola's works. Perhaps more than before, there will be detractors who chide the movie for being just as vacuous as the characters in them; and yet, below its sleek shiny surface lies a certain integrity Coppola adopts in her filmmaking that is worthy of praise and admiration. Right till the very end, she sticks to playing it as it is, offering little comfort to those who indulge in the same materialism as her characters or those who decry it; yet this chronicle of American culture gone wrong is magnetic all the way through, a riveting watch that we enjoyed immensely.",True
54622,4 September 2020,meolibra,After We Collided (2020),10.0,"I read the After series 2 years ago and it was a life-changing experience. I re-read it again recently cause I've miss the characters so much. The second movie has done such a great job bringing our book Hardin and Tessa into real life. Anna, Roger and the crew have created such beautiful and amazing storyline. Of course there are differences, but ***like Anna said***, something is better written than being displayed in front of camera. About the actors and actresses, all of them did such a great job, I almost thought the main characters are actually in love. Hero successfully brought Hardin's love for Tessa into real life, and Josephine is so talented. Love how they give Trevor some more stories than the book, but I was still hoping for more Zed stories. Overall, this movie is better than any romance I've seen. This movie carries depth and lessons, even if you haven't experienced but can still relate to. I'm glad that the 3rd and 4th movies are in production soon, but I hope more countries (for example in Asia) can watch the movie. Also, waiting for a release day on Netflix or DVD announcement. This movie is worth the watch.
Tbh English is not my mother tongue, so I'm trying my best to express my love for After We Collided. Thank you for making Afternators' dream comes true.",True
55253,7 July 2020,OhItsStefan,The Last of Us: Part II (2020 Video Game),9.0,"Let me start this review off by saying that some people do not like this game, and that is fine. This game is very depressing and bleak at times and some people just don't enjoy those types of games. For me, this game is very special in a lot of different ways, I really enjoyed playing through this game and the 20-30 hours playthrough stuck with me long after I had seen the credits.Most of the criticism other people have stem from the fact the story is not what they wanted/expected from the game. The game takes alot of risks which might not resonate with everyone. The game follows Ellie, after the events of The Last of Us (Part I) Joel and Ellie have settled in Jackson, a settlement run by Joel's brother Tommy and his wife Maria. After a traumatic event, Ellie sets out for revenge on those who wronged her and the ones she loves. This sounds like a classic revenge story but it is much deeper and more nuanced that it might seem at first glance. ***Like I mentioned*** before, Naughty Dog took some risks and made some bold choices with some of the characters and events that take place. The game requires you to think about it and play with your brain on. There are multiple layers to the story that get peeled off as you progress through the story. In the end those layers will reveal a bittersweet core that will make you question the character's choices and actions in a haunting and beautiful way. It might not be the story I expected or wanted but in the end I realise it was the story that was needed for the characters we loved. It's an incredibly nuanced story that really forces you to reflect on the characters we love so dearly because of the events of the last game.Gameplay has been refined by quite a bit compared to the first game. Combat is incredibly grounded and realistic. Enemies are smarter and will make an effort to take you down in various ways. Besides that different factions in the world have different strategies when it comes to combat which makes combat varied, fun and tense. Crafting is still here, there are now more and different recipes which gives you tools to tackle encounters in different ways. Movement has seen improvements, compared to Joel, Ellie controls very different. Ellie is much more agile which again, makes the encounters feel different. The addition of a jump button, although it was marketed as a major feature, was not used a lot. Jumping and going prone was mainly used for environmental puzzles and exploration with the latter also being very useful in combat. Collectibles come in the form of trading cards, artifacts and coins, these are a fun little distraction that can keep you busy while exploring the massive environments Naughty Dog has given us to explore.Graphically the game is stunning, even on base PS4 visuals and performance of both the game and the hardware are phenomenal. Character models and environments are varied and look incredible. Long grass moves in subtle ways when the wind blows, ice breaks when walking through it, rain drops reflect on metallic objects. Everything looks and feels just right. Combine that with the amazing sound design and you've got yourself an amazing, immersive experience that is rarely topped by other AAA games.This is definitely one of the most controversial games to have ever come out in the last 20 years. The game is very divisive for alot of people and the reviews reflect that as well. I'll end this review with on of the best quotes I have heard to describe this game.""If you finish the game wishing you had (spoiler) , you may have won the game you played with your controller but you lost the game Naughty Dog was playing with you""",True
55623,7 July 2020,zkonedog,The Twilight Zone (1959–1964),10.0,"Just recently, I finished a kick of re-watching all 156 episodes of the original Twilight Zone series. If I were to average out all my individual episode rankings, that number would probably fall between 7-8 stars. Yet, when looked at as a whole rather than the sum of its parts, The Twilight Zone is 10/10 all the way.When TZ is hitting on all cylinders, it is easily one of the greatest anthology pieces ever produced. The lion's share of the credit here goes to show creator and writer Rod Serling, who is truly one of the most inspired individuals to ever put pen to paper in screenplay format. The deeper themes about society or humanity are just as relevant now (if not sometimes more so!) than they were upon original airing.It absolutely astounds me that this show premiered in 1959. That was ten years before the moon landing! I can't imagine what my grandparents would have thought about a show like this, dealing with space travels, aliens, and all manner of oddities hardly a decade removed from the Second World War and firmly in the Cold War.***Like I said***, the best TZ episodes are treasures that will be enjoyed and studied for decades to come. Does the show have its share of clunkers? Of course. But only a true handful of episodes are truly bad. The others largely depend on personal sci-fi tastes or the time-period in which they are viewed.About the only reason I would even consider dropping this from a perfect ranking is the fourth season of the show, which produced hour-long episodes. Those efforts aren't bad, per se, but are simply padded with dialogue to fill time rather than written for a longer runtime, for the most part.When taking the long view, however, The Twilight Zone firmly resides in my top-five television programs of all-time. Despite premiering well before it could fully be appreciated, having to deal with the inane TV standards and practices of the era, and being constantly underfunded, Serling managed to keep everything afloat and write some of the best multi-genre material ever seen on the small screen. Whether comedy, mystery, horror, sci-fi, human drama, or any other genre is your game, you'll likely find something to enjoy in the breadth of The Twilight Zone.",True

And that you, as a reader/ news consumer, don't have any idea or feelings about the situation.
Interesting that in reviews of Black Mirror episode ***like this that is mentioned*** that it's not really Black Mirror. I think it's absolutely Black Mirror because it is a Black Mirror episode.

56011,9 December 2019,Becky145,A Blue Ridge Mountain Christmas (2019 TV Movie),8.0,"Yes, it is one of the same old tired storylines that Hallmark likes to do but it did have some different twists though, which I appreciated. It made it appealing and I actually like this movie's version of the storyline better than most. I really liked what felt like real conversations that people would have and family moments. The mother and daughters giggling and hugging each other. The sisters on the bed dipping cookies in milk and having real sister moments. The father daughter conversations. All of the acting was done well including the little girl. For a child actor she was really quite good. They all clicked well and were believable in their roles. I said I wanted to hang out with the mom, after she introduced her daughter in the diner. She just seems like a cool, fun mom!The main characters were a little slow at "" falling in love"" but they were busy with the inn and working on the wedding. I didn't mind because the story was interesting enough and I knew they would get there. This might be the first Hallmark movie were there was no silly ""misunderstanding"" at the end that almost splits them up but they find their way back to each other, after clearing the air. Thank you! Finally! Those misunderstandings in all those other movies are just silly and unnecessary.There were a few misses in there. The usual overload of Christmas decor and what was up with so many people milling around the front porch and driveway? It looked like a five or six bedroom house. If the father and daughter each had bedrooms, then that left three or four guest rooms. There should not have been that many people going in and out with luggage.***Like I said*** earlier, I enjoyed this version of a storyline that's been done many times but it was different enough to make it very enjoyable. I did not realize Rachel Leigh Cook was in it until it started and I got very excited to see her! I would definitely watch this again.",True
56157,9 December 2019,sadboy93,史崔特先生的故事 (1999),10.0,"Only watched this film recently in 2018, I don't know why I have a huge obsession with this film and still do to this day, it's such a simple and poignant story. About an older man, visiting his brother who he heard got a stroke, and wanting to see him one last time. He travels 300 miles by a lawnmower of all things. the film doesn't convey a lot about the main protagonist Alvin, every now and then he slips out little things revealing more about his character. The whole time you just wanna hear more about what Alvin's got to say, giving life advice, his up bringing, his ideals, living in the middle of rural America in Iowa, his interest, his hobbies, how he didn't want to get the bus to Wisconsin to visit his brother, or ask a family friend, or anyone he met on the way, he was so adamant about doing this on his own and it makes you wonder why the whole time.(Spoiler ahead)
He does it! meets his brother played by Harry Dean Stanton only for a short scene, they hardly say anything, nothing profound, and the film ends with Alvin looking up at the sky, and the sky turning into the night sky the same way the film starts, I wished there was more words that were exchanged between the 2, before hand they didn't speak for over 10 years over an petty drunk argument, wished they dove into that a bit more, about their past relationship, I don't know... The film's great! non of my friends won't like it, but it's an interesting watch.I love how this is a true story, that took place in the 90's, the film was set in the 90's (obviously), and was MADE in the 90's (1999) I love films that are set and made in the time period it's set a made in, like in 'The Basketball Diaries' (1995) Although the story took place in the 70's, the director wanted the movie to be set in the 90's.The Japanese poster for the film is one of my all time favourites as well as it's aesthetics used, in the poster is Alvin driving the lawnmower at day time, but the sky is black. I hardly see any other medium of art depicting this, not even Photoshop of a beach in the middle of the day with a black starry night sky instead of a bright blue sky, wish there was more art like this, and also love to know who designed the Japanese B5 Chirashi Flyer poster!One of David Lynch's least likely films he's made, produced by Walt Disney Pictures, I'm not sure why he wanted to make the film initially, but I'm glad he did, I'm also glad Richard Farnsworth got the nomination for Lead Actor for this film. Apparently Richard was in a lot of pain due to his cancer during the shooting of this film, which I'm fascinated with and at the same time saddened, it's interesting how something ***like that could bring a lot more depth to the character, seems a bit method which I'm guessing wasn't Richard's intention (maybe for David's but who can really say for sure, I doubt it was), Richard was of similar age to Alvin, David even once said*** in an interview that Richard was born the play him which I love.After watching this film it's made me want to watch more Richard Farnsworth films, buy a really good CRT TV, and watch old westerns or films in similar vein to this one, kind of like shows that Quentin was in to that are depicted in 'Once Upon a time in Hollywood' with Leo's character.
And even go to rural America and learn more about the culture of the Midwest, why small towns exist, how they come to be and where are they now, and all of that.
I love to know any other films or shows similar to The Straight Story, the only other film I can think of is Nebraska (2013) Which coincidentally I'm also obsessed with.",True

The show shouldn't have had this ending, the characters acted out of character, their whole personality changed out of the blue. I can believe Daenerys lost it, but for Jon to do what he did after a few words from Tyrion? After he was betrayed ***like that in season 5? Why ruin Jon after everything he's been through? That said***, why ruin all of the remaining characters. It sure helps get over a show when you no longer care for the characters-they must have done it for us viewers. The system that was created is not much better than the monarchy-the nobles are gonna choose who suits them-the game of thrones did not end. Tyrion, whom I used to love, really didn't deserve to be the hand again since he ruined things for the one he served previously. I could say more, but there's no use wasting my time on this show anymore. I just wonder, after this ending, why would anyone want to watch a prequel of this show?

He speaks about certain events as if he is experiencing them right at the moment, from his point of view.The chicken and the egg, both happened at once.This story makes me wonder if Time itself is the linear thing that we perceive.Well. Now I think we know what's waiting for Jon in the Walmart. The only question is what does Laurie Jupiter have to do with it, and didn't Jon love her at one time too, or, he does. Still does? There's no such thing as past tense or future tense here. ***Like I said***, the bricks all fall at once.The way the story is, it melds into the original limited series so perfectly, it is as if this was an untold part of that same story.I don't understand why Alan Moore refuses to have his name put on any of this, and he fought long and hard to keep his name off of any media based on his work. And I have not always been a fan of Damon Lindelof's (Prometheus) work (We were so wrong), but he has made up for that here by being the heir apparent to Alan Moore, who used this very style of writing not just for Watchmen but for the original Excalibur comic and the Inferno Crossover, as well as the Captain Britain series.I can't imagine where this goes from here, Dr. Manhattan, he knows. He knew. Something occurs to me about Dr. Manhattan, although he knows what is going to happen, it appears he generally does not act upon it until that thing actually happens. Except in the case of one Angela Abar.This was the episode that I have waited for this entire time, I even had to watch the ultimate cut of Watchmen a few times just to get an injection of Dr. Manhattan.

The submission page says it was declined for 'unspecified reasons' - but this happened months after it was approved, with hundreds of people having weighed in on its helpfulness. There are no spoilers. There are no R-rated cuss words. There is no racism, sexism, or any other kind of hate-mongering. Maybe IMDB has a problem with reviews suggesting that a film is so lame that the audience needs be in a state of chemically-induced mind-alterment to enjoy it. I don't know. I've seen that in plenty of reviews, but I took that bit out of the title this time around, and will only encourage good ole America-approved alcoholism from now on. In any case, taking down perfectly reasonable reviews with no explanation and no accountability - especially for major studio titles like this - is simply unacceptable.Folks, what do you want to see here, in the user reviews? Do you want a bunch of grade school quality shillery from fake studio puppet accounts? Or do you want REAL people to write what they REALLY think? Because apparently, it's not just shills we have to worry about - there is definite financial incentive for the mods to delete negative reviews of major studio releases. Because even a hundred lazy shill reviews cannot counteract the power of one scathing, honest review - and the shills can be spotted from a mile away, especially if you look at a reviewer's account history. (I am not saying this is what happened here, but the circumstances are certainly suspicious...)It's almost pointless to repost this now, since it's no longer on theater screens and my two cents aren't going to influence anyone not to shell out the $20 for a ticket. But here it is anyway.ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is not worth one star. But it's not worth 9+ or whatever it currently has either. So in the spirit of Thanos and his pokemon gauntlet, let's balance out all the studio tools who gave this a 10/10 with undeserved but necessary one-star ratings.Realistically, it's like a 4-5/10. It's a dumb superhero epic with a ton of overpaid stars and over two dozen films leading up to this ""storyline"". It has the eye candy of hundreds of thousands of work hours worth of top-dollar CGI animation. It has spaceships, one-liners, explosions, magic jewels, and robot suits. It has very large characters with impressive rippling muscles, and the promise of a sequel that will put all the franchises back to normal so everyone can continue making money.What it doesn't have is a point of any sort, other than to just bludgeon you over and over again with ""entertainment value"". Which basically comes down to one big CGI battle after another, 'cause watching these human action figures trade one-liners is only entertaining if you know and care about the MCU and its vast horde of intellectual properties. On occasion, the dialogue exhibits a tiny bit of self-awareness of just how silly this whole enterprise is (***like when someone said***, ""you mean there's a Spiderman *and* an Antman?""). That's nice. And for a brief moment here and there, it almost becomes the dark and grandiose space opera it actually wants to be - before quickly reverting to its tropey, Disney-fied comic book superhero franchise self.If your mind was somehow blown by this film, then you must have found Inception to be ""thought-provoking"". (Yes, that is meant to be derisive.)On the other hand, if you spent the entire 2.5 hours scoffing with bitter disappointment, you're not off the hook either: scoff at yourself for expecting anything other than what you actually got.

56967,9 December 2019,TheVictoriousV,婚姻故事 (2019),8.0,"Netflix's Marriage Story came to me at a funny time in my life and I will disclose no more personal facts than that. It is the first Noah Baumbach project I have given my full attention - unless we count the Wes Anderson films he's worked on, as well as, of course, Madagascar 3 - and I gather it is a semi-autobiographical tale about how love stories may end. Not with fireworks, but with divorce papers, custody battles, and costly meetings where, sometimes, the two partners are truly taught to hate each other. This, according to Tim Grierson, is what Baumbach tells us of the ""Divorce-Industrial Complex"".This is the sort of movie that many will berate in that it is insufficiently glamorous and escapist, the way movie-films ""should be"" (it features hot celebs in unflattering, very human scenarios). But I'd say the perfect medicine for those who want life to be like the movies is a movie that's like life. Or at least, how life may turn out if two people fail in their devotion, or are told that they did; to quote Grierson, ""the happiest people in this movie are the divorce attorneys"".Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are undoubtedly the biggest selling point of the project, knocking it out of the park as stage director Charles and his actress wife Nicole, going through a messy divorce that forces them to travel coast-to-coast. They are surrounded by the likes of Laura Dern, Alan Alda, Ray Liotta, and even Wallace Shawn for a little while. All of these legends do well enough that I routinely forgot I was watching a film, rather than a documented ordeal.Particularly noteworthy, however, is the actor playing the couple's son. Too often, unconvincing child performers are dismissed as ""just kids"", ergo we shouldn't complain that they aren't as engaging or engaged as the adult actors - many of them veterans, to boot. Azhy Robertson comes close, however. We shouldn't ignore films like this, just as we shouldn't ignore Room and Looper.marriage storeThe movie may sound dispiriting and sad as I have described it (for some, this will be therapeutic and remind them that they're not alone), but be aware that it treats a difficult scenario with a certain sense of humor. Another ostensibly depressing film I saw this year was About Endlessness, by the great Swedish auteur Roy Andersson, which was about a larger number of upsetting aspects of human life.All the same, it was technically a comedy; not pointing and laughing at the subjects, but having a sense of humor about the harsh parts of existence. Baumbach, with his commentary on divorce agencies and his lifelike characters, is ultimately more serious than Roy Andersson, although we're still permitted to laugh about the messiness of it all, the way the central couple one day might. Marriage Story affirms that a romantic comedy can be more - so very much more - than the inoffensive pop entertainment we often assume rom-coms ought to be.Much ***like The Irishman, this is another acclaimed film to get the ""limited theatrical run followed by immediate Netflix release"" treatment, further legitimizing the trend-spotting paper I wrote*** on the future of cinema this spring. More and more respected filmmakers are taking streaming seriously (see also Roma and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs of last year's Oscar Bait season), but I certainly believe Marvel premiere events will keep certain film theatres alive. Some theatres might also survive due to having screenings of old classics for devoted cinephiles to attend, but those types might find a substitute in the Criterion Channel.Of course, it's also nice that instant online release allows me to catch more of the well-liked movies in a year and then run my mouth about them to no-one in particular. I think we'll see Baumbach at the Oscars.",True
57334,17 December 2008,ShadeGrenade,"The Cult of...: Survivors (2006) Season 1, Episode 4",10.0,"After enduring the latest episode of B.B.C.-1's 'Survivors', I watched this excellent half-hour documentary about the original show. More drama was to be found in the clips here than has so far been evident in Adrian Hodges' hodge-podge. The opening episode - 'The Fourth Horseman' - is an object exercise in minimalist drama. It opens with Abby Grant ( Carolyn Seymour ), a middle-class housewife, awaiting her husband's return ( Peter Bowles, in what was basically an extended cameo ) from London. News reports are claiming that people are succumbing to a deadly new plague. Civilization is gradually breaking down, and what few survivors are left are forced to band together, to live and work as a community. It was more believable because it was seen to happen gradually. Not the case in 'Survivors 2008'. No sooner had the opening titles faded than Mankind was gone.The original survivors were drawn from all walks of life, featuring a smattering of elderly people, whereas the new intake are young, good-looking and more interested in sex than staying alive ( A kick up the backside to 'The Radio Times' writer who claimed that the original was about men in jeans sitting around kitchen tables, discussing crop rotation ). Complaints about the show being far 'too middle-class' are trivial. When I watched 'Survivors', I was too absorbed in the drama to notice anyone's class.Good though the documentary was, it had flaws. The somewhat sniffy commentary would have us all believe that '70's Britain was not a very nice place to live, blighted by strikes, food shortages, and petrol rationing. Is today any better though? We have had the global financial crisis ( sorted out by a Labour Prime Minister. Who would have thought it? ) with banks collapsing and the credit crunch causing long-established firms like 'Woolworths' to go to the wall. Will the Noughties look ***like Utopia to future generations? Surprisingly unmentioned*** was the dispute between Terry Nation and 'Avengers' writer Brian Clemens, who claimed the show's idea was originally his.Producer Terence Dudley was a megalomaniac, driving Nation away after the first series and then ( unforgivably ) sacking Carolyn Seymour. The show never really recovered ( Dudley's behaviour also alienated Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, creators of his earlier sci-fi hit 'Doomwatch' ).Despite the production difficulties, 'Survivors' was a cracking show, being both well acted and intelligently written. I could not believe my eyes when characters in the new show were seen accessing the internet. In one stroke the series' purpose - the depiction of a world where Man has to learn to get by without technology - was defeated. It would be akin to a remake of 'The Changes' having 'Nicky Gore' using a laptop after fleeing a deserted London.It was good to see Seymour, Lucy 'Jenny' Fleming, and Ian 'Greg' McCulloch talking about the show, and their characters. They were indeed a great team. You cared about them. Seymour's open admission of alcoholism was indeed shocking.Director Pennant Roberts also had some interesting things to say, such as how the show had been inspired by a bestselling book on self sufficiency ( the same one also inspired the sitcom 'The Good Life'! ).As it ended, I was left wanting to see the original 'Survivors' again. If only to wipe away the memory of Adrian Hodges' lifeless and stilted 'reimagining'.",True

57954,18 December 2008,blanche-2,Remember the Night (1940),8.0,"Though I don't like ""Remember the Night"" as much as ""Christmas in Connecticut,"" it is a wonderfully warm Christmas film, notable for its Preston Sturgess script and the performances of the two leads, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray.MacMurray plays a prosecutor, John Sargent, who is stuck with a shoplifting case right before Christmas. He manages to get the case delayed until the New Year, but Lee Leander (Stanwyck), the shoplifter, complains that now she won't have a warm jail to spend Christmas in. He learns she's from a town that's on his way home, so he offers to drop her off there. That doesn't quite work out - her mother doesn't want her - so she winds up coming home to his family, which consists of his mom (Beulah Bondi), his aunt (Elizabeth Patterson) and their handyman (Sterling Holloway). It's there that she experiences a true family and real love. Before the week is over, Lee and John have fallen for one another.I always assumed, from ""My Three Sons,"" that Fred MacMurray was a capable actor, and kind of ordinary. Watching his various performances on TCM has changed that impression. Here he's relaxed, natural and very likable, and has his usual good chemistry with Stanwyck. She's wonderful - tough yet vulnerable.I have a feeling the ending was dictated by the Hayes Code, but this is still a good movie. Preston Sturgess didn't think so - he didn't ***like the cuts, so this was the last film he wrote*** and didn't direct.",True

58291,6 May 2020,AhmedSpielberg99,"Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972)",9.0,"With a shaky, handheld cam and a documentary style, Werner Herzog captures the nature at its grittiest, wildest and most most perilous to tell a story of a megalomaniac's descent into madness. It's a story of a man whose God completely denounced him because of his greed and delusions of grandeur, and therefore cursed him in the midst of paradise and turned it into hell. A hell of illusions, mirages and unfulfilled desires, preceded by inexplicable, dreadful nightmares and an ominous warning of a disturbing sound of silence. This is the Wrath of God that comes upon whoever exceed his limits as a human being.What strikes me about this is that it's a story of a grand scale, compressed into a compact 95-min long film without losing a pinch of its epic quality, and that's due to the perfect pacing, I guess. As my first Herzog, I'm really impressed by how his raw docu style feels so cinematic. Un***like other directors who only use some kind of a pseudo-documentary style to give their films an authentic feel, Werner's camerawork, as I mentioned*** above, fully adopt this style throughout the entire film. We even get, once in a while, observational and poetic shots. And, all of a sudden, a ghastly and hideous image is revealed, and then lingered upon it. Moreover, the way the film changed its tone and became a bit whimsical and implausible at the end is simply astonishing. However, I think there are some jarring tonal shifts between one act and the other. Other than that, this is a peerless masterwork of filmmaking and storytelling.(9/10)",True

The acting is not that good in 2 and the visual is all different now. The first season was totally binge worthy..in fact I watched it twice. This second season just isn't all that great. What happened? It is as if they ran out of money and made a cheaper version for the second season which is too bad. I was really waiting for this second season but I am very disappointed.

60324,7 September 2013,raphaklopper,Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991),10.0,"OK, that's the thing with James Cameron, when he announces something it takes almost a decade to come out (still waiting for Avatar 2 and 3). Same thing with ""The Terminator: Judgment Day"", after the great success of ""The Terminator"" Cameron received letters and desperate requests to he make a sequel and then he promised he would. 6 years have passed, Cameron had time to do the Excellent ""Aliens"" and the underrated ""The Abyss"", and finally in 1991 came this film, and every minute of the wait was worth it! ""The Terminator: Judgement Day"" is still considered one of the best sequels ever made, not by critics who said that was not even at the level of his predecessor, but by fans who won over the years. Cameron made both classic films totally different, and unforgettable !The story begins 10 years after the events of the 1st movie and we found Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) arrested in a rehabilitation clinic accused of attacks of madness and visions with killer robots and the end of the world to come thanks to a nuclear war. On the other side of the story we have John Connor (Edward Furlong), the prodigal son of Sarah Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the machines, a rebellious and troublemaker boy living with adoptive parents (the characteristics of a true leader, nothing like a suffered childhood to build a strong warrior). But as in the first, a killing machine was sent to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the birth of John, in this one a machine is sent to assassinate John, this work is now up to an advanced model of Terminator the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). But just like in the 1st film, the resistance sends someone to protect him in this one, not a beautiful blonde soldier this time but a T-101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger).In the 1st movie, Cameron picked sci - fi and action elements evolving them, here he takes on its own material and evolves it to a new level. The critics considered that a more expensive copy, but fans considered a MAGNIFICENT recycling taking everything bigger and bolder. While the 1st movie had a dark and violent tone, and the feel of a thriller, on this one Cameron takes everything to a more personal and dramatic side and even to a philosophical tone at a point. All this thanks to Schwarzenegger character suffering (positively) a big change, while in the 1st movie audiences cheered for his destruction and threw insults after insults, putting him on lists of the greatest movie villains. In this he reveals himself as the savior of both Connors, swearing allegiance and obedience to protect both with his life (in fact he was programed to defend them, but in both ways will all lead to the big show), leaving the audience cheering for him and the Connors by every passing minute .From the philosophical point , is the reason that the Terminator it is also programmed to understand the human senses and feelings, not only to understand their weaknesses, but through an excellent narrative that goes with the film giving several scenes between John and the machine and its relationship protector for friendship. And at the same time with this, Cameron starts a vision of human values in various scenes that lead to an amazing final message that make everyone reflect (it was also here that Cameron began to make some critical reflections in all his films).Reflections and relationships at a side, the part when I said that Cameron took everything to a new level, I mean everything. The action of the 1st film, was shootout in police stations and car chases at night. In this one we have two killing machines tearing limbs and throwing each other through walls and FREAKING AWESOME and huge car chases (***like I said***, recycling at its best). But it was not just the action that had a huge evolution, but also the stunning visual effects that the film contains (and very advanced for its time).In levels of performances, Schwarzenegger after the 1st film he entered on the map, on this one he definitely gets to be the iconic face of the action genre; Linda Hamilton in the first was a fragile waitress seeing her life suffering from a huge changeover, in this one she became the human exterminator, showing that after the death of her love one she had to learn how to survive alone (and very well by the way).Many fall trying to decide which Cameron's Terminator is the best, for me is hard to say which is above the other. Both have completely different tones and many different aspects and both truly unforgettable, and both received the same title of being the best action movie ever made but Cameron showed that it could be much more than that. With superb performances, stunning visuals and breathtaking action, both ""Terminators"" are both classics to be remembered forever!10/10",True

60690,8 September 2013,PassPopcorn,Blue Jasmine (2013),8.0,"In 1951, Elia Kazan's classic movie A Streetcar Named Desire was released. It was an adaptation of a play and it featured revolutionary amazing acting. It won 4 Oscars (3 for acting) and it got many more nominations. A Streetcar Named Desire is highly admired even today. More than half a century later, Woody Allen made his Blue Jasmine. Blue Jasmine, while certainly not being a remake or an update of A Streetcar, has many elements that can also be found in that 50's masterpiece. Unfortunately, it is almost positive that Woody's latest movie won't achieve the status of a classic, 50 years from now. However, that doesn't mean that Blue Jasmine is a bad movie. Quite the contrary, it is a rather good movie that deserves your time.Blue Jasmine follows Jasmine French (Cate Blanchett) - who changed her name from Janette - in two separate timelines. One timeline, mostly through flashbacks, depicts Jasmine's former life: she was happily married to a rich man named Hal (Alec Baldwin), went to parties, had everything she wanted and was satisfied with herself. This timeline was not present in A Streetcar Named Desire, and it's the greatest difference between these two movies. The other timeline depicts Jasmine's life on the present day: she is poor, she has nowhere to go so she turns to her sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) who lives in San Francisco, she had a nervous breakdown because it turned out that her seemingly perfect husband Hal was a thief and a cheat and she lost everything she had. Therefore, Jasmine wants to begin a new life in Frisco.The first thing worth mentioning is that Blue Jasmine is not a comedy and is much closer to Woody's more serious movies (Match Point, Interiors, Another Woman) than to his lighthearted ones. Of course, there are few jokes here and there but nothing really notable. Blue Jasmine is a pure drama and, frankly, it is very good. Woody's writing and directing is good as ever as he smoothly intertwines the two timelines in one story. I'm pretty sure he'll get an Academy Award nomination for both directing and writing. And talking about Academy Awards, I must compliment the one person who is certainly getting a nomination, and quite possibly winning the award - Cate Blanchett. Blanchett is the jewel of this movie. She shows her incredible acting range while performing as the multi-layered character Jasmine. The role of Jasmine was a pretty tough role to play, there are so many (sometimes even contradictory) aspects of her to portray and Blanchett did it masterfully. I'd suggest that Cate start working on her acceptance speech! The rest of the crew did a good job, too. Sally Hawkins is another actress in the cast who might receive a nomination for her portrayal of Jasmine's sweet sister Ginger. Bobby Cannavale did fine as Chili, the counterpart of Brando's character in Streetcar, although his character was much more likable than Brando's. Also, it was nice to see Louis C.K. starring in a pure drama, even though he didn't have much screen time.I think it's safe to say that Woody made yet another great movie and that his days are not through. Nonetheless, ***like I said*** before, I doubt that Blue Jasmine will be remembered in 50 years and it surely won't be regarded as Woody's best work to date. Despite all that, Blue Jasmine is still a beautiful, thought-provoking and, essentially, a very good movie, Considering how bad this year has been for movies up until now, I'm glad that Woody made me spend one wonderful evening watching Blue Jasmine.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",True
60714,8 September 2013,TheLittleSongbird,Great Expectations (1981– ),10.0,"The other two are David Lean's film, the most atmospheric and inventively-directed with the opening graveyard depiction unparallelled, and the 1989 series with Jean Simmons and Anthony Hopkins, before seeing this series that was the most faithful adaptation to the book. The others were the 1999 adaptation with Ioan Gruffodd and Charlotte Rampling, which was very good and until seeing this series was the only one to get adult Estella exactly right; the respectable 2011 series, though that suffered from being rushed and having two very miscast(but admittedly more age-appropriate) leads; a hugely flawed but somewhat decent animated version from Australia; the 2012 Mike Newell film which was a mixed bag; and the very dull and uninspired 1974 TV film which had only the costumes, the setting of Satis House and four performances(those of Miss Havisham, Magwitch, Jaggers and Joe Gargery) going for it.And then there's this 1981 adaptation, as an adaptation, along with the 1989 series it is the most faithful adaptation to the book, and on its own merits it is fantastic. There is hardly anything that came across as wrong, apart from a few moments where the pacing rambled a bit though the book did have that as well. It is very compellingly adapted, paced in a way that the story doesn't feel too incomplete, stretched or thin and it is also very atmospheric and intricate. While the opening scene is still done the best in Lean's film, this adaptation is a very close second best, and it has one of the better executions of the ending(1989 just about tops it). The dialogue is literate and very Dickenesian, some scenes do have a lot of talk then again so did the book. The length was not a problem, it is long but Great Expectations is a big book and difficult to adapt, suited better for a mini-series of this length than a feature film, so a long length is necessary to develop all those themes, situations, conflicts and characters.Visually, it's also very good. It is beautifully detailed, well-photographed and the important scenes are done with atmosphere and care. And while it is a very meticulous production, it doesn't forget the desolation that we see in the opening scene, in the marshes and in the scenes with Pip as a child. Some of the negative Amazon reviewers deemed it as too bleak, a complaint that doesn't really make much sense to me, the earlier chapters and scenes actually require a bleakness and the book does have a darkness to it as well. At least it doesn't veer on too grim and Gothic, in the 2012 film Mike Newell did try to bring out the darkness and conflict of the story and emphasised on it too much, this version doesn't do that. The music also suits things nicely.You couldn't ask for greater performances either, all are among the best in their respective roles and some go even further in being definitive too. This is the version with the best adult Pip and Estella. Gerry Sandquist is appealing and with a warm humble presence, he is attractive too without being too much of a pretty-boy like Douglas Booth for the 2011 adaptation. Sarah-Jane Varley is by far the most convincing adult Estella, even better than the Estella in the 1999 adaptation, her looks are enough to convince you what Pip sees in her in the first place yet there is still the coldness and haughtiness without being a overly-hysteric condescending snob that Sarah Miles in the 1974 film portrayed. She isn't too old for the role, and far from passionless. Colin Jeavons is also the best Wemmick, you miss the character's delightful wedding scene which was the one really notable absentee, but Jeavons plays the character very endearingly. Derek Francis is also one of the best Jaggers' too, though that is a character played well by all the actors playing him in all the adaptations.Patsy Kensit is also one of the better young Estellas, though Jean Simmons in Lean's film is the one you'll remember the most. Young Pip is convincing. Tim Munro plays Herbert Pocket beautifully, eccentric and quaint as he should be. It was really nice to see his poor parents too, an opportunity to know more about him. Phillip Joseph characterises Joe with dignity, and Linal Haft's Orlick is memorable. The Magwitch of Stratford Johns is genuinely terrifying to begin with, but you feel for him later on and Johns does show a noble sympathetic side too. The performance that stood out the most was Joan Hickson as Miss Havisham, Gillian Anderson and especially Jean Simmons may have been a little more convincing physically but along with Simmons and Martita Hunt Hickson gives one of the most outstanding interpretations of the character. A very authoritative performance, and she captures the mystery and ruination of the character perfectly, with her scenes with Pip and Estella played with momentum and absolute conviction.Overall, a fantastic series and adaptations, along with the Lean film and 1989 series one of the best versions of Great Expectations. Contrary to what some of those who didn't ***like it have said***, it's not too long, not too slow(even with some rambling parts, and the book does share some of the blame) and not too bleak, this is a fine example of how a literary classic like Great Expectations should be adapted. 10/10 Bethany Cox",True

60954,8 September 2013,Amari-Sali,Odd Thomas (2013),8.0,"Anton Yelchin is one of those actors who, I feel, have a sort of Tom Cruise or Will Smith appeal. And while I haven't seen his two biggest films, Star Trek and Terminator Salvation, I am quite a fan of Like Crazy, Charlie Bartlett, House of D, and a few other of his movies. Alongside the appeal he brings to the film, we also have Willem Dafoe and Addison Timlin, mostly known for her work on Californication. Together, these three create a film which seems like a cult-hit that is either about to get canceled or was recently canceled.To begin, let's talk about the characters. Our lead is the character Odd (played by Anton Yelchin) who would have been named Todd, but there was an issue at the hospital. Odd has medium like abilities and fits his name quite well. However, rather than present some weird socially maladjusted guy, we get this strange, yet charming, young man who is highly likable. Alongside him is Stormy (played by Addison Timlin) who is his childhood sweetheart and, sort of, his partner in fighting crime. Together they make such a cute couple to the point where they are so cute it is 50's sitcom corny. The last person to note is Willem Dafoe's character who is Wyatt Porter, chief of police, who works with Odd in an unofficial capacity to solve crimes in the town of Pico Mundo.The film's story, overall, feels like a summarized version of a show's first season and even so, it really gets you into things quickly. This is done primarily through Odd breaking the fourth wall and talking to you directly throughout the movie as he introduces himself, his friends, his powers of being a medium, and his life as a short-order cook and detective. The main thing the story focuses on, outside of Odd's relationship, is his medium powers which: allow him to see the dead who have not moved onto the next life; give him clairsentience; find people he is looking for; possibly have visions of the future and see these demon-like beings known as Bodox, which remind me of the demons from Dead Like Me. Now, these Bodox play an important role for they are what gets the story rolling. You see, Bodox usually only appear as individuals when someone is going to die, but one man known as Fungus Bob Roberston (played by Shuler Hensley) has an obscene amount of them around his person. This leads to Odd trying to piece together his dreams, as well as co-worker Viola's (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw), while using his gift, in order to try to solve a series of murders, and one main mystery, which all could lead up to an utter massacre.Being completely upfront, this film is very corny and campy. The dialog has a 50s sitcom style at times, with cursing, which will make you not take things seriously, but thanks to Yelchin's charisma, and Odd breaking the 4th wall, you are kept engaged throughout the film. But, perhaps, the most interesting about the film is the story. The way Odd Thomas is written, the mystery doesn't really get all that complicated, but still has the ability to throw some twist and turns in there which make you think ""why didn't I see that?"" All the while, it tries to balance a tone of seriousness when handling death while trying to keep its campy quality consistent. Also, just to note, despite how corny their relationship was, I greatly admired Odd and Stormy's romance and how the movie used it to get you further invested into Odd as a character.But, in many ways I feel the corniness and campiness of the movie works against itself as it creates a sort of appeal. For one, Stormy and Odd's relationship is so lovey dovey that it really feels like a superficial romance. Also, as much as characters may yell and look serious when there is a murder or something similar, the campy tone of the movie makes it so that it never holds the weight you think the scene should. Add onto that, the mystery and investigation itself feels almost rushed to truly make it feel ***like this wasn't really written to be a movie, but perhaps a pilot or a season summary as I mentioned*** before. I would even compare this to Drinking Buddies, in terms of how it is written more to be a series than movie.Overall: Possible BuyThis film has the type of appeal which makes it feel like it has the makings of being a cult-hit, if it was a TV series. The reason I say that is because, as campy and corny as it is, it remains highly likable. Odd as a character shows how come Anton has the ability to do films like this and then go do blockbusters. He has the type of persona which made people like Will Smith and Tom Cruise stars, and his role in Odd Thomas is no different. Odd is eccentric, charming, and has that Veronica Mars way of looking for trouble and then when you add on Dead Like Me's campiness, it makes it so each character feels setup like you are going to see them past this movie, fall further in love with them, and ultimately it makes the film feel like a pilot with the commercials cut out. At the same time though, with it being so campy, it makes ever event which would otherwise create a deep seriousness, feel like when someone died on Dead Like Me or Pushing Daisies. Yeah, it's serious, but only really for that scene. So, overall, I think this is a possible buy for this is the first film in sometime I can imagine watching again, if just to show other people it. The ending though, I swear to you, may make you cry.",True
61080,15 February 2016,Riddler2,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008),10.0,"Now Before I start this review I want to say this film is hated by a lot of people because of the supposed problems with this film which it does not have, it's an Indiana Jones film and a worthy instalment of the Indiana Jones series just a hell of a lot of fun and a wonderful family movie a movie we all can experience with our families and it will transcend and endure and be passed down to each generation's children and grandchildren that's what Steven Spielberg's gift is he makes films for each generation of children to experience, for example The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was my first exposure to Indiana Jones and my Dad Showed me the other 3 films afterwards and I loved them all I just think The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not the appalling disgusting abomination to the Indiana Jones Series that everyone says it is, it is a worthy addition to the series and just a hell of a lot of fun with great action set pieces charming and entertaining performances from Harrison Ford, Shia Labeouf and Ray Winstone it's really good family fun the direction by Steven Spielberg is outstanding this is the film he needed to make after the outstanding Munich he needed to have fun again and enjoy himself which he did in bucket loads and it shows in the shot compositions the outstanding score by John Williams each new Theme tells the story of the character or location depicted or shown on the screen Mutt's theme is music for a young rebel hungry for adventure a youthful spirit a cocky character Irina Spalko's theme is a sexy 1940's femme fatale theme with a slithering saxophone solo accompanied by the orchestra and the Crystal Skull's theme is a theme reminiscent of a choral humming or a ritual it sings to you and teases you to give in to it's remarkable but albeit dangerous power just outstanding work by John Williams, Must mention Karen Allen's return as Marion wonderful to see her again she was always my favourite Indiana Jones Lady but it shows that she has aged quite a bit since 1981 cause boy did she look hot in 1981! I just feel strongly for the film because of many reasons, one it's not a piece of garbage ***like everyone says it is, two the film has a lot of family entertainment in it a lot of good laughs just like the first film and the third film and three the score is outstanding by John Williams! So to finish off don't write it off just because there is a huge group of people who hate this film and no disrespect to the people who hate the film but they are wrong the film has sadly become one of the few Steven Spielberg films that is overlooked despite the fact it's part of the Indiana Jones series which is a shame, on the back of my DVD of the film there's a quote from a review which describes the film as a wonderful family comedy and I am inclined to agree with the reviewer who said*** that it's a wonderful piece of family entertainment don't listen to the haters of this film enjoy it for yourself I do I do not care about the haters of this wonderful family movie!",True
61407,16 February 2016,lfcfanjoe,Foodfight! (2011),1.0,"Have I ever been more bored in my life? The answer is probably no.Let's kick things off with the production of this film because I think this is pretty necessary. This hopelessness of a film has been in production since 1999, and several different studios have been working on it, if that already tells you that quite a few people have gave up on it what's the point on watching it? That's what some people knew because it only got $75,000 back from a $65,000,000 budget, so obviously it was a flop. ""Foodfight"", was also denounced from taking product placement, which could've got them more money, to make it better! The studio that made this atrocious film also decided to get it out as quickly as possible since some of the characters in the poster weren't in the actual film. GEEZ! Another reason to back this up is that the ending where the main character proposes to his girlfriend is really rushed, this could've been a good scene but it was wasted by the studio who wanted to get it out quickly and get some money, which they didn't do.There were quite a few famous actors in this film such as Charlie Sheen however; one member of the cast shocked me quite a bit: Christopher Lloyd as Mr. Clipboard. His acting in my favorite film ever: Back to the Future was breathtaking and in this he was breathtakingly bad, how can he do this? I believe he should stay with acting because his voice acting was awful. Plus, what kind of name is Mr. Clipboard; it's insulting to say that the creators have no imagination with that name. Charlie Sheen is another fantastic actor, what a disappointment from him. All his lines were dull, even if the writer wrote them like that, he could've put some energy into his lines, unfortunately, he didn't and that's what made crap like this. The final voice actor who baffled me was Hilary Duff, the actor who played Lorraine Baker in Cheaper by the Dozen. She portrayed Sunshine and made the character sound like a 5 year old, this was ridiculous! Judging by this film all of these actors/actress shouldn't be voice acting. On the subject of voice acting in general, it was dull and lifeless it made the whole film drag. During this film, there were a few speeches and somehow they were loathsome, speeches are supposed to get you hyped not bored! If I could use two phrases to sum up this film they would be ""simple and Plain"" and ""It's a trap"", yes a Star Wars quote in this crap, and I hated it! The final thing I'm going to say in this paragraph is about the cheesy one -liners, because it feels ***like you're having a cringe attack when you hear them, they're so dull and the way they've been said*** is ghastly.One of the main monstrosities of this film was the animation, Google it now because it looks like it was from a PlayStation 2 game and it was made in 2012! If the production history didn't scare you well the animation will because it's horrendous! Another thing about this film is that it's 100% dull, none of its interesting, if I told my brother to watch this he'll watch about 15 minutes of it and turn it off, it's that boring, I've sat through a few boring movies but this one is the worst. One of the reasons why this film is so boring is because it's really unfunny, I had more laughs out of Superbabies than this, and I think I laughed about once in 90 minutes, that makes me feel depressed. Another reason why this is so boring is the fact that the plot was so basic. I can say it in 9 words: Evil Nazis take over shop, heroes must fight them. That's the plot. I'll let you take some time to realize how poor it is. Atrociously bad. You may be thinking why I said Nazis and I'm going to tell you now; the evil organization is called Brand X and their characters and strategies are a strong resemblance to the Nazis, the evil woman whose name I can't remember is strangely like Hitler because she's good at speeches, has a very good manipulation strategy and back in 1945 Hitler was a handsome bloke apparently, and this evil woman was no exception, she was made to look good. Even her henchmen had slight German accents and were crazy, one of them reminded me of Joseph Goebbels, and not good who ever made this diabolical film. As I mentioned before the ""imaginative"" creators gave some really good names such as: Rex Dogtective! What a lousy and ridiculous name, even I could call the main character something better, for example: Jeff or Buster. You see a dog's name with a detective meaning I am better than these creators, but to be honest, it's not hard. On the same subject, in this ""film"" the lead role becomes a General? Because he starts to formulate plans like a general does but he's a detective? It's a bloody complicated movie in my head. One final reason why this film was bad is because it had really bad sex jokes in it; you may be thinking ""sex jokes in a kid's movie?"" This has been done before and as an example, Shrek has quite a few but not this bad. Again, these jokes make me cringe and question the world. There are a few other reasons why this film is bad but I don't want to milk it. So here's the final paragraph, the conclusion. I believe this film was a waste of time, money and effort. I've already explained why and I just want to get to the next movie because I really can't be bothered talking about this movie. I want to forget about it: 0.6/10.",True
61560,16 February 2016,johnplocar,It Follows (2014),9.0,"In a time where that is so depressingly rare to say ""I just saw a great horror movie"", I am so glad that I finally got a chance to see it. I will go into the plot, but I must press that it is on the ridiculous side in terms of the concept of what this film is about. If you like horror movies like ""Christine"" or ""The Entity"" that have a ridiculous concept, but it is done so well in its writing and direction then this is a movie for you. The movie is about a girl who is haunted by a ghost after having sex. Yes. That's right. Now before you stop reading, I know that it sounds like it is a ridiculously stupid concept for a movie that only exists so that there can be more of a reason why there's nudity in a horror movie. Not the case at all. There is some nudity in the flick but honestly not a whole lot, the majority of any nudity to be found is usually by the ghost itself and it's not even close to being sexy, it's seriously creepy and disturbing. ***Like I said*** before, this is a movie that if written or directed by anyone else this would have been pretty bad. Like with ""Christine"" being about a killer car or ""The Entity"" being about a sexually assaulting ghost, those could have been done so horribly wrong if done by anyone else; in capable hands however they became something really eerie and haunting. In the movie the girl is tricked into having sex with a guy and so he ties her up and explains to her what the ghost does and how it works as far as he knows. The ghost goes after one person; if that person has sex with another then it moves onto them until the ghost kills them. Then the ghost goes back to the person prior and then the one before them and so on and so forth. The ghost can only be seen by the people who have sexually interacted with the ""infected"", the ghost only walks but it never stops. It keeps going and going until it reaches their target and practically massacres them. It can change into anyone; whether it is a stranger or someone they love just to get closer. There is no explanation as to why the ghost is doing this, how it all started, who started it, and it is completely unneeded to enjoy this movie. The pacing, the mood, the direction, the cinematography, the characters, the scares, the ghost all work so well and so disturbing that receiving some sort of explanation only would have impeded on the enjoyment to be had. It is creepy just watching this poor girl try to figure out how to get away from this thing. The girl, played by Maika Monroe, does so well in this role. If played wrong this could have been some annoying blonde ditz that I'm begging to get axed off but instead I am immediately stricken with such sympathy for her and this awful thing that she is forced to go through...all because she liked a boy. It's actually kind of heart breaking and even sadder as I think more about it actually. But anyways, in a lesser written film too she could have been an irredeemable character and just went straight to trying to pass it on to someone else but instead she tries to run or kill it or anything really before she thinks about doing something like that. There isn't a bad character in this whole movie, they are all pretty likable and I definitely like that even the skeptic in this movie (that can be found in most horror movies) still is sympathetic and is actually trying to help instead of mess things up or do something stupid like most usually do. And I cannot get over the awesome cinematography in this film, it is so well shot and I was blown away. Anyone else who sees this film will probably say, ""What makes the cinematography so good?"" Please just pay attention to the lighting at the very least. In any other horror movie, even ones that I've liked over the past few years, would be so darkly lit that it is anyone's guess as so what is going on. This movie does not care about realism in that regard, if it is going to put a spot light over a car that makes absolute, zero sense to have any light shining over the car then dammit that is what's going to happen. Also the framing of some of the wide, isolated shots were reminding me of something out of ""The Shining"" and the camera work screamed Wes Craven more than once. Seriously this is a real good horror film, see it if you can. Do you know how rare that is now? Guess how many good horror films I saw last year...like freaking three. So far we're already halfway through this year and I've only seen one legitimately good horror film. Just this one. I want more like this!",True
61575,16 February 2016,t-hf,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015),8.0,"So this review will be a bit of a change from others on this site at the moment. I am going to review the movie of course but I am also going to offer some brief thoughts and insight into the current early signs of audience backlash against this movie in the month and half following its release.So when this movie came out I was unable to see it due to having no money and had to wait for payday, just under a week after the release date. Needless to say I went to see it as soon as I had money in my account without even waiting until my friends were free to see it with me (not because I have no friends or anything....*sob*). For the most part, I was frickin blown away. The film has some breathtaking action sequences, some great humour and it's great to see our favourite characters back in the franchise along with some captivating new leads. Overall, the film is a blast and the most fun i'd had at the movies all year (at the time at least, ""cough"" Deadpool ""cough""), but.....Like many people, I was caught up in the hype train and would be ready to love anything this movie had to dish out. I mean with JJ Abrams as director, Lawrence Kasdan as writer and all 3 members of the original cast returning, I told myself that nothing could stop this movie from being amazing. Make no mistake, it is a lot of fun and a great time at the movies ***like I said***, but now that the hype has died down and i've had the chance to get many of my friends and colleagues opinions, I can say objectively that the film has a lot of problems. Now you've most likely by now heard the biggest problem of all: that the film's plot is derivative of A New Hope. Now everything you've heard is true and the plot bears nearly all of the similarities and emotional beats that the original contained, but this film was hyped up to be a homage to the original trilogy so I have to admit im not sure why people were so surprised. On the other hand, it does markedly at points feel like an attempt to recreate the original film's magic, which presents a problem in that the original was the very first of a franchise, whilst this film is a sequel, and therefore should be a continuation and progression of not just the story, but the story format. However, if you're willing to get past that, I believe that the film does introduce enough originality to stay fresh.There are other problems, some being that the character development and chemistry may be too rushed for some, but to be honest, so was the chemistry in the first one. I mean come on, Luke and Ben have barely known each for a day/day and a half at a push by the time Ben dies and yet Luke reacts as if he's lost a much closer relative. Some other movie-goers may also find that the film raises more questions than it answers, but if you give the forthcoming sequels a chance, i'm sure that they will shed more light. All we can do now is hope that Episode 8 improves The Force Awakens in the way that Empire improves A New Hope.Well there you have it, there are my condensed thoughts on The Force Awakens. I hope that you wont be discouraged by the waning hype train and audience backlash that this film is currently starting to receive. The movie really is a lot of fun and you will enjoy it, just don't expect to be blown away by it the same way A New Hope and Empire did. This is the first film in a trilogy after all and i'm sure they're holding back their trump card for Episode 8.",True
61674,16 February 2016,brando647,It Follows (2014),8.0,"It's always refreshing to find a horror movie that succeeds in freaking me out to some extent. David Robert Mitchell's IT FOLLOWS manages to do just that. Watching it the first time in total darkness and slightly less than sober, it had me jumping at shadows when it was over. It's just so perfectly atmospheric. It feels so retro and modern and the same time, and it comes with a John Carpenter vibe thanks to the eerie synth score from Disasterpeace. This has got to be a breakout hit for both writer/director Mitchell and his cast of unknowns. I've been trying to do my part in spreading the word on the film to friends, as I know it'll be easy for a small indie film like this to pass under the radar without getting the attention I feel it rightly deserves. IT FOLLOWS is essentially a film about a sexually-transmitted poltergeist. We're introduced to our heroine Jay (Maika Monroe) as she's preparing for a date with a guy she's feeling pretty good about, and the date goes well enough that the two of them close it out with a tryst in his car in an abandoned industrial parking lot (romantic, yeah?). Then it gets freaky. He knocks her out and ties her to a wheelchair, but it's for her own good. He needs her to listen to what he's about to explain: he has just passed It on to her. What ""it"" is, he has no idea. But it was following him and now it's going to follow her. Then only way to get rid of it is to have sex with someone else and pass it along. It will follow you, no matter where you run. And never, ever let it catch up to youI went into IT FOLLOWS expecting a slasher film. A murderous specter that haunts you, following you until it gets close enough to murder you, and all you can do to survive is pass it down the line. The premise sounds ripe for some real cheese but nope. Mitchell presents IT FOLLOWS with full seriousness and it works so incredibly well. The death count is low in this movie because it isn't about the kills. It's about the constant nagging fear and paranoia of the victim. They're forced to constantly keep one eye over their shoulder and if you suspect someone in the crowd isn't what they appear, you run. The spirit/demon/ghost/whatever will attempt to disguise itself if it means getting close enough to its victim. And the best part? Mitchell never bothers explaining what ""It"" is. I can't state how much I love that It is left a mystery. From start to finish, we waste no time speculating on what it is. We just ride along with Jay and her friends as they scramble to figure out how to save her; granted she could just pass it off but that's no guarantee. If ""It"" manages to kill its next victim, it just reverts back to the previous. Then there's the whole ""willingly giving an unsuspecting victim a death sentence"" thing that (understandably) bothers her.IT FOLLOWS feels as much a psychological thriller as it is a horror film. ***Like I said***, it wasn't the slasher I was anticipating so we spend the majority of the movie with Jay, watching how she handles her bleak situation. She starts the film so bright-eyed and hopeful. She relaxes in the pool, playfully shooing away neighborhood kids peeping through the fence, and kids around with her sister and their friends. Her life appears incredibly simple and happy. Then it all changes and she is absolutely traumatized. She takes to locking herself away, barricading doors and trusting no one. Nowhere is safe. But her friends are there for her through the whole of it, even if her story sounds more than a little insane. IT FOLLOWS has obvious allusions to the inherent dangers in sex (particularly STDs) but I feel as if there could be even more layers that I haven't picked up on. This is a movie that almost demands multiple viewings, as you're bound to discover more each time. There's a recurring theme of water (what with constant use of pools and lakes) but I haven't figured out the significance behind it yet. It's one of those elements ripe for post-viewing discussion. IT FOLLOWS is tense, haunting, and it would stick with me long after it finished. I have few complaints about the film but the one major misstep that bothers me each time is the final act, when Jay and her friends devise a harebrained scheme to put an end to It. But it's a minor quibble that doesn't detract from my glowing praise for the film, and I really recommend anyone that's considering IT FOLLOWS should give it the time.",True
61679,16 February 2016,MrGKB,Wonderland (2011),3.0,"...this is not a ""6"" film, not by a long shot. It's barely a ""3,"" and more likely should be rated even lower. Shot on a shoestring, ""Wonderland"" fails to rise above its threadbare premise in any significant way. Its storytelling is murky at best, while its visual elements are haphazard and irksome. ""Wonderland"" remains a piece of work that will keep its viewers' fingers firmly on the fast forward button.I'm not too surprised that it's failed to attract any reviews on this site until mine. I suspect that's a combination of detractors being unwilling to waste keystrokes best saved for worthier targets and admirers being unwilling to commit to praises that they know are undeserved. I'm a bit unnerved myself, but mostly by having taken the time to sit through the thing, at least as much as I could bear. ***Like I said***, the fast forward button is your friend on films like ""Wonderland.""Sad to say, this is just another one of those deceptively hyped pieces of product that my unwary public library video purchaser made the mistake of acquiring. I can only counsel any reader of this review (which really isn't a review, I admit; it's more like a simple warning label) to avoid wasting time with this one. I've already done that for you.

It would give you some jump-scares, especially when your man turns into the werewolf and kills people like a wild wolf dog!I really loved Jenny Agutter and David Naughton's characters relationship blossoming throughout the whole movie. I actually didn't expect that they would be become a couple but, there ya go, thats the best of unexpected surprises in films like this!Even if it was gory, this is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen and I think it needs to deserve more than one Oscar!",True

It is still great to see the Shadowhunters come to live yet again ( and, ***like I wrote***, hopefully for a very long time). All of the episodes have been good so far and in my opinion the cast has been well casted. My girlfriend especially likes Alec. But I think all of them are cool and well suited. In my opinion I think it is a shame that some people keep comparing the series to the book. Sometimes it seems as if it closes their eyes for what this series can offer us viewers.

Understated, yes, but oh so heartwarming. A little dash of the 1930's ""Freaks"" for good measure, in a good way.The academy awards are such bunk(crap). A movie off the radar like this is essentially incommunicado per the awards, yet sitcom-like drivel like ""Terms of Endearment"", ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", and such win best picture. Forget awards. This movie rises above the standard issue formula that rings true for the academy, like so many ""Indy Movies"" do. I ***like to think of the lot of understated*** Indy movies as above and beyond what radar we typically place our ""understanding"" of movies in. Twin Falls goes far beyond those expectations.

62152,10 September 2011,sharit_sinha,Love U... Mr. Kalakaar! (2011),9.0,"Let's be honest... what do we like in a movie now-a-days? Salman Khan uttering dialogues with extreme attitude & high-octane bravado, Katrina Kaif glittering the screen with her diamond-white skin, Shah Rukh Khan stretching his hands out to call her reel-love... gravity defying action, brain-defying comedy and cloth-defying dance numbers! Why do we go for a movie? To get a lesson on honesty, sincerity and the crafts of being a good person? No... of course not! Then movies like Shool, Ghaath, Kurukshetra, Munnabhai MBBS would have made honest men out of us.We just like spending 3 hours watching something that doesn't put much pressure to our unused parts in the brain.Frankly, I ***like watching all the types of movies mentioned*** above. But, that doesn't stop me from taking chance with a movie, that actually has a soul... and that doesn't stop me from liking movies that doesn't meet the above mentioned criteria.This is the case with Love U... Mr Kalakaar! The day Tusshar Kapoor was signed in for the lead role, the movie's fate had a bold lettered FLOP written in it. Because, audience wants Tusshar Kapoor to only play a paranoid mute clown again and again.Well, who else would have done this role anyway? A movie about a genuinely good person, spreading his goodness like a virus - who likes that? Good is so overrated! People want their heroes to be bad! You will say - hey, we liked 3 idiots! Yes, of course, we are incapable of liking something until it's larger than life. Life isn't a colorful canvas - life is dull, monotonous, painful, tragic - for an average Joe, life is non-happening, uneventful, where he goes to a 9-12 job 5 days a week, sits on the same desk, does the same work and spends the weekend thinking maybe the next week would bring something interesting - but it doesn't.Love U... Mr Kalakaar is honest, straightforward film that never goes loud or overboard with its story or the acting. It doesn't do anything insane or shocking, it doesn't thrill you to bite your nails - it just looks at you into your eyes and tells - I may not be a very happening part of your life, I may not be as shiny as your exterior, I may not be stylish like your gel-dipped hair, I may not be able to flex like your biceps, I may not be able to impress people like your street-smart tongue... but eventually you will have to consider me, because I am the most important part of your existence - I am your soul.Anyway, my review is as follows - an honest & decent love story, that isn't just a mushy mushy tale of never-ending love. It's a story that every member of a family can like, if they give it a shot. I haven't seen Tusshar so controlled, since Khakee. Amrita is perfect as a bubbly, beautiful, smart & self-confident girl. Ram Kapoor adds a lot of glamour and weight to the movie with his opinionated father persona. And it's lovely to see Madhu after so many years, in such a weight-ful role. Among other actors, Prem Chopra & Yateen Karyekar stand out.The story is predictable, but the journey is still worth experiencing. If you still have the heart in the right place, give this movie a try - because it does.",True
62203,10 September 2011,TourettesPersonal,Fright Night (2011),8.0,"The original Fright Night was already a cult classic which makes this remake unnecessary. But since all vampires these days are less scary and ***like what Evil Ed said*** ""Love Sick"", it can be necessary for some reason. Bringing back the true vampire camp. Although it's not as scary as the original but Colin Farrel's performance improves the vampire villain. This Fright Night is endlessly watchable and fun. This may sound strange but I think this version is better than the original.The original have the disturbing schlocky masks but this version actually has the vampire danger and thrills. The credit goes to Colin Farrel. He gives a lot of vigor and terror to the evil vampire. David Tennant has his own Peter Vincent. His charisma and delight shines through all of his scenes. Just like Roddy McDowall, David Tennant nearly steals the show. But Farrel really owns this show.It's a welcome back, actually. It's not a cash in remake. It's the returning of the vampire horror to our cinemas. Our vampire movies these days are just tired and relies to nothing but the senseless violence. And some of them are in love with a bland girl and sparkle in sunlight. But the biggest thing that is missing in most modern vampire movies is how scary these monsters are. They are not only bloodsuckers. They can be terrifying for somehow.The filmmaking is obviously good but some of the CGI tones the scares down a little bit but it works though. The score sounds nothing like the score of the original but it's true to its vampire genre. The movie is shot in 3D but most of the film is dark and 3D usually dims the aspect of a film but if you are in for some blood and sparks coming out of the screen then try it. Not quite recommending though.Overall, Fright Night is enjoyable. Maybe the biggest mistake they made is the jump scares since Fright Night isn't really fond to that trend. Well, this is definitely better than all the unnecessary horror remakes we usually get every year. Colin Farrel made a lot of things better. Vampires are evil again. It has plenty of joys and thrills. Fright Night is recommendable by bringing back the true elements of the genre.",True
62209,10 September 2011,Boba_Fett1138,The Graduate (1967),8.0,"When people think of this movie they often seem to forget that this actually a comedy. And a pretty good one it is! It's a very simple movie, in about every way imaginable. It was a very cheap film to make, with a very simple and straightforward story in it but none of this is a downside really, since the movie actually is all more about being subtle with its approach and its storytelling.Its simplicity actually makes this a very honest and sweet little film. It makes the characters human and believable ones and all of the emotions and actions within this movie sensible and easy to identify with.But ***like I said***, people foremost shouldn't forget that this is actually being a comedy. It's so easy to see or remember this movie as a drama, with perhaps some thriller elements in it, since the premise of the movie actually make it seem that way. It's also not really a comedy that tries to force its comedy upon you. Just like the entire movie; the comedy is subtle. It's also not the sort of stuff that will make you laugh at loud but it does occasional put on smile on your face and its approach makes the movie a very pleasant one to follow. You could really thank director Mike Nichols for this, since its a style and approach that he has mastered and has put to use in some of his other movies. Pretty surprising from a guy who prior to this had only directed one movie, which was a completely different one as well, namely; ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"".The story does at times looses some of its focus though and we just have to assume- and take for granted a lot of things within the movie. This isn't always really working but it in no way ever makes the movie a bad one to watch, just a not perfect one, which is no big shame of course really.The movie is also being made really better by its actors. It actually made me realize once more what a great comedy actor Dustin Hoffman actually is. His delivery and timing is absolutely spot on at times. It actually was one of his first real movie roles, which makes his achievement ever more impressive. Also a fun fact hat he only was only 6 years Anne Bancroft's junior, even though in the story she was supposed to be twice the age of the Hoffman character.It's a (deliberatly) minimalistic made movie but that is really not saying anything about the quality of this movie, which is simply very high. Just take the Robert Surtees cinematography for instance, which was simply superb. It got also nominated for an Oscar and really should had won as well, in my opinion. The movie was further more nominated in 6 more categories but it strangely enough only won in the best director category. I say strangely enough, since it is quite unusual for a movie to only receive an Oscar for the best director and win nothing else. But Mike Nichols still of course deserved it though. It's a really well made and directed movie by him! It also was the only Oscar he has won, till date.A really good but above all things also a really enjoyable movie to watch! Even after all those years it hasn't lost any of its power.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",True
62362,10 September 2011,Galina_movie_fan,Midnight in Paris (2011),10.0,"It had to happen sooner or later, and finally it did. Woody Allen and Paris ""fell"" in love with each other, and, as the result, we, the viewers, received a precious gift from the master of subtle, intelligent and charming dra-medies, gentle and charming ""movable feast,"" the new movie ""Midnight in Paris "".I have been a fan of Woody Allen for long time and seen all his movies, those that he made, and those in which he starred or only wrote the screenplay for. I look forward to each of his films and I am ready to love them before I even see them. I knew I would like Midnight in Paris, but I had no idea how good it was. From the first frame, following the Darius Khondji's camera on such familiar but uniquely beautiful streets, alleys, boulevards and quays of the City of Light, it was hard not to fall in love with Paris and with the film of Allen, his love letter to the most famous city in the world, capital of love and Mecca for writers, artists, musicians and artists to whom Paris gave inspiration during all times and epochs - Belle Époque 1890s, the Golden days of the 1920s, and today, right now...Midnight in Paris is a delightful, kind (yes, this is Woody Allen), light, and charming film, which can be described as A Paris Midnight Magical Movable Feast. Paris in the film is beautiful during day light, night time, bright sun, and rainy hours. Oscar nominee, the master cinematographer of many remarkable films, including Panic Room, Se7en and Evita, Darius Khondji worked with Allen on three films: Anything Else (2003), Midnight in Paris (2011), and the next film, the Roman project Bop Decameron (2012).Soundtrack consists of Allen's favorite songs from the 1920s-30s by such songwriters as Cole Porter, Glen Miller, and Enoch Light, and from the repertoire of Josephine Baker and Juliet Greco. For the original film theme, Allen picked the guitar composition of the French jazz guitarist Stephane Wrembel ""Bistro Fada"". Wrembel's influence and source of inspiration has been the music of the famous French Gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt, whose longtime fan and admirer is Woody Allen himself. According Wrembel, Allen was searching for a typical French-Parisian melody, reflecting the spirit and atmosphere of Paris. I can confirm that the film theme and the songs that Allen picked up for Midnight in Paris are important, integral component of the film's charm and add to the romantic and joyous feeling that the film brings to the viewers.As always, in Woody Allen's movies, the actors give uniformly good performances. Owen Wilson is very convincing and likable as Gil, Hollywood's successful screenplay writer who works on a first novel, a protagonist, a much younger, attractive, and funny Woody Allen stand-in. Adrien Brody played the best role since The Pianist (very small cameo, but memorable and hilarious). Kathy Bates was very believable as a famous literary critic and friend to the struggling talented writers and artists. Alison Pill was impressive as the bright, outgoing but showing the signs of instability wife of the celebrated American writer. I hardly recognized Corey Stoll but liked him a lot as another famous American writer. Watching Marion Cotillard, I had no problems believing that the character she played, Adriana, could have been the muse and the girlfriend of not just one but three amazingly and uniquely talented world renowned painters. Rachel McAdams (Inez, Gil's not so romantic fiancée), Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy (Inez's parents on the business trip in Paris who don't seem to approve their daughter's choice), and Michael Sheen (Paul, Inez's pedantic and arrogant former boyfriend from college) were quite good as not very likable Americans. The First Lady of France, Carla Bruni appeared in a small role of a museum guide.The story itself was so lovely in using the time travel as the plot device and brought so many funny and sharp one-liners, dialogs and scenes as well as the plenty moments of recognizing the beloved literature and art figures of the past, that I sat and smiled happily during the whole film. ***Like I mentioned*** in the beginning, I expected to love the film even before I saw it and knew from the very first scene that I was in for something very special but my husband, who is much more reserved in his ratings and not often calls a film a masterpiece, used the word for Midnight in Paris and asked whether the film has won some prestigious prizes. Well, the awards season is several months away, but for me, and I am sure for all Woody Allen's fans, Midnight in Paris is a great prize from the writer/director.",True
62556,11 September 2011,boondocksaint20,Hobo with a Shotgun (2011),9.0,"This is the movie that Planet Terror and Death Proof should have been. It is a dark, fun, over the top violent, sleazy film that provides a roller coaster ride for the viewer. Un***like the aforementioned*** two films, this one really feels like you are watching this in a trashy Grindhouse cinema.Rutger Hauer was simply awesome as the nameless hobo who has had enough of the scum destroying his town. There are plenty of over the top gore moments including heads blown off at close range, amputations, stabbings, electrocutions and much more. It is all shot in good fun (think Dead Alive or the Evil Dead).Everything about this movie was a throwback to the 1970's/1980's schlock films that were all about uncensored shoestring budget thrills, bare-bones plot, real life inaccuracies, grandiose speeches about life from two-bit characters, etc. Even the ending, which I will not give away, felt exactly like a typical Grindhouse film.Excellent B-Movie homage with great characters and special effects.

62756,11 September 2011,kdnor2011,V for Vendetta (2005),10.0,"In the last decade, we have gotten a lot of comic book movies. Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, Spiderman, X-men, Superman Returns, and the Marvel's Avenger's series. Yet of the comic book movies that I've seen, V for Vendetta is my personal favorite. Yes, I like this movie more than The Dark Knight, more than Iron Man, even more than the Avengers. And I had never even heard of the graphic novels before, but now I kind of want to read them, and I don't even read comics.I love futures where a totalitarian government has taken over. It's a great warning that if we give too much power to our governments, then we will lose all freedom. Even though the film is set in Britian, it applies to pretty much any country with a non-communist government. It's ***like V said***, ""People should not fear their government, government should fear their people."" The character of V is very interesting. You never see his face, so there is a bit of mystery to him, and as the story goes on we learn more about his back story. I don't know if you would call him a hero, or anti hero. He's basically a terrorist, but he's doing it for the right reasons.Natalie Portman is great, I've always liked her since Phantom Menace, and she is so hot, even when she is bald. The villain is great, the dialog works really well, and it's just a plain awesome movie. I mean they blow up important buildings while the 1812 Overture is playing. And it's really funny at parts.There are a few problems I have though. There is one part that doesn't make any sense to me, and I will have to spoil part of the movie to explain it. Who did V get to interrogate Evey. I mean he can't be that good at throwing his voice. We see hands when Evey is getting her hair cut and they weren't burnt. Plus why did he do it, he is just that heartless. And I didn't care for the flashback about Valerie, I know it gave Evey hope to get through her ordeal, but for me it just slowed things down and besides, we already knew the government imprisoned homosexuals, so why did we need to be reminded.V for Vendetta is my favorite Comic book movie, I love the plot, characters, and just find it to be a fun movie. Some things don't make sense, but it doesn't stop it from being a really good film. If you love Comic book films, check it out",True

I agree that I was iffy about them not including Mushu, music, etc. However, after educating myself on Chinese culture and that Mushu was disrespectful, I understand their decision. ***Like stated***, this movie is not supposed to be light-hearted with a bunch of fun songs. It's about war. It's about a warrior. They did a great job twisting the story into their own version, while honoring the original Mulan poem and the animated movie. As a fan of the original Mulan, I am beyond proud of this film. I laughed, I cried, and I ended the movie feeling so grateful to have experienced it.

I've had several friends tell me to watch this because they know how much I like Sam Elliott. I thought it was a 60 minute drama, not a sitcom so that was my first surprise.My second unpleasant surprise was the damn laugh track. Yes, I know it's filmed in front of a live studio audience but I'm sure they are told when to laugh. I don't mind a laugh track when there is something funny to laugh about but to have the laughing when a character says something innocuous is annoying as hell. I was tempted to not even watch this show when I heard the first fake audience laughing. When are producers going to realize this is 2020, not 1956 anymore? Most people don't like laugh tracks and if your show is not funny, don't make believe it is.I don't see all the hoopla with this show but ***like I said***, I'm only four episodes in. Not finding a lot of humor here except the first episode with the Uggs on Colt's feet. Nothing in the the four episodes that had me laughing out loud like I used to do with Frasier. I guess that's why there's a laugh track which was surprising on a Netflix original show.Then I've been reading that Masterson was fired because of an alleged rape or sexual impropriety from years ago.

64619,8 July 2020,tom-hanson1-851-871606,The Last of Us: Part II (2020 Video Game),10.0,"I am a huge The Last Of Us fan, and ever since I heard that they were creating a part 2 a few years ago, I was so excited ever since.I have only just recently completed the game after over two weeks of starting it, so there is plenty of action and story to it, however reading some of the reviews, apparently too much story for most people.I checked the reviews and star rating on here just a few hours after it was released to find that somehow people had apparently already completed a 30+ hour game in just two hours, hmm. I think the rating would be much higher if people didn't come on here to write bad reviews and badmouth it without actually playing it for themselves first. Is it because you have to play the whole game as two different girls? Or is it because they made Ellie a lesbian? If so, that is quite sad.The gameplay, the combat, the graphics and attention to detail are really quite incredible, I can now understand why this game took so long to master...I mean, even the dogs have their own names and the little things like the posters on the wall, the hand-written notes, all of these little things add up to make this game pretty beautiful.Regarding the actual story, I still don't 100% know how I feel about it. I found myself constantly thinking ""I must be near the end now"" to which the game would keep on surprising me. Not at all did I expect the story to last as long as it does, however I won't complain, as ***like I previously stated***, the gameplay and the graphics are so damn good that I secretly wanted it to keep on going anyway. I note that a lot of people are confused as to why you have to play the 10 hours or so as Abby when they could have quite easily cut this out. However this for me is the smartest part of the game. Playing as Abby you grow to understand why she did what she did to Joel, and you begin to notice that she isn't this monster that the game earlier portrays her to be, and in fact she is actually quite the opposite (mostly). The story really plays with your emotions and really puts you in the shoes of both Ellie and Abby, making you understand how they must both be feeling throughout the game.When the story brings you to living in a farm house with Dina and the baby, you begin to think that this must be the happy ending. Perhaps this would have been an easier ending, by allowing Ellie to put the past behind her and to live happily with a family, however, the game continues to surprise you even more.As Ellie struggles to bury the hatchet, she makes her way to find Abby to finally get her revenge and to avenge Joel. In the final confrontation with Abby, I began to feel extremely saddened by seeing the state that Abby was in, reminding me of images from WW2. You as the player controlling Ellie may find yourself not wanting to fight Abby, and instead wanting to make peace.The reason Ellie does not kill Abby is simply because she realises that no matter what she does, she can not bring Joel back to life. This final action scene was very dark and hard-hitting and it left me with a very strange feeling inside with a lot left to think about.Perhaps the sole purpose of the game is to test your emotions and to find out more about yourself.10/10 from me - it is far more than just a game.",True
64734,8 July 2020,david_rudy_lee,A Lizard in a Woman's Skin (1971),9.0,"This was a film that I heard about, mostly because I enjoy films from Lucio Fulci, but also because giallo films tend to have interesting titles. This one really does fall into that category for sure. I didn't know a lot about it aside from that, as I've avoided films that did walkthrough reviews or spoilers. I do have to thank Duncan from the TPUTS Collective, as there was a selection of the Where to Begin With Series and made me watch ahead of my schedule. The synopsis is the potentially unhinged daughter of a British politician is accused of killing her hedonistic neighbor after she witnesses the murder in a dream.Now this is an interesting film for sure. We start off with Carol Hammond (Florinda Bolkan) trapped on what appears to be a train. It shifts over to a dark room with a bed and on it is Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg). She is not fully dressed and her breasts are exposed. It then shifts to both her and Carol naked. We're then taken to Carol while she is in psychotherapy with Dr. Kerr (George Rigaud) who is analyzing this dream. I took this as Carol has having lesbian feelings toward Julia, but Dr. Kerr gives his views which have to do with repression and wanting to be more free like her. I do feel this applies as well.Carol is married to Frank (Jean Sorel). I do believe he has a daughter Joan (Ely Galleani). What throws me off here is that Frank doesn't look old enough to have a daughter this young, but I digress. Frank works with Carol's father, Edmond Brighton (Leo Genn). Through a scene at dinner where Carol, Joan, Frank, his secretary Deborah (Silvia Monti) and Edmond, we hear that Julia is having a loud party. This really bothers Carol and her father. As Edmond goes to leave, he notices a car outside that is painted flashy.In the office the next day, Edmond gets a phone call and as Frank is leaving, asks if he has been unfaithful to his daughter. He laughs off the accusation and leaves. It is storming that night and we see that he is in fact cheating on her with someone. That night, Carol has another vivid dream where she murders Julia. We also get an odd image of Jenny (Penny Brown) and Hubert (Mike Kennedy) who are watching from a balcony. Their eyes are white and it should be pointed out they're hippies.It then turns out that Julia has been murdered. Inspector Corvin (Stanley Baker) is in charge of this investigation. Carol is freaked out by the news, as the evidence points to her dream and her being the prime suspect. There's a lot more to this story that will draw everyone in as some people have things to hide and it begs the question, who did kill Julia?Having now watched this film, I have to say, this doesn't necessarily fit into what I expect from Fulci. I don't mean that in a bad way by any stretch, because I could argue this is proof that he's a great filmmaker for sure. My other thing is that when it comes to a giallo film, if I can't guess the ending, I'm happy. That applies here.This is an interesting film in the red herrings make sense and even though I know when they make something obvious, it isn't the answer. This movie plays with that and still got me ***like I said***. To start off with, I liked our lead in Carol. My immediate thoughts with her are that she is sexually repressed. She has lesbian urges toward Julia, but with society and her standing, she denies them which cause her dreams to be as they are. There's a reveal with her later in the movie, which was quite interesting with the evidence we are given.There's also Frank, her husband. I don't like him as he's having an affair. I picked up the idea that Carol in her repression isn't meeting his needs. It is hard to fully hate him, as I feel the time period it was a bit more socially acceptable to have a mistress, especially where it is taking place. Regardless, I'm not a fan. I do like that he kind of becomes the main character, as the heat turns to him as evidence gets revealed.We also have the interesting cast of characters of Jenny, Hubert and Joan. I've already said that Joan looks to be a bit too old to be the daughter of Frank, plus there's this odd interactions between them. It is possible though, as there's a gap of 19 years. Joan actually knows these two hippies and there's an interesting angle where Hubert admits to the crime, but it doesn't turn out to be possible. He and Jenny though still know something. I also ***like that the title of the movie is stated*** by Hubert and it makes a lot of sense why as it involves drugs.That will take me to the pacing of the movie, which I have to say was just fine. The movie runs 95 minutes and I don't have a problem there. The movie never gets boring, despite there's really only one death and that is Julia. Sorry if that is a spoiler, but that's not to say that things do not happen. We get hallucinations from Carol as well as there is someone chasing after her to kill her. That really helps to the drive the tension when it is needed and the story keeps it from getting boring. Much like many giallo films, the ending is abrupt as we're given the explanation, but it fits for how the story plays out.I really should go to the acting next. I thought that Bolkan was really good as the lead here. She plays this character so well that without it being explained until the end, I was picking up different things about her character. I'm impressed if you can do that. Plus she's easy on the eyes if I'm honest. Sorel is also really good. I like how the focus of the movie shifts from Carol to him as he becomes a suspect. I like that the police are doing their investigation, but Frank is doing his own as he is the suspect, falling into that troupe of non-cops doing investigation. Baker is good as the detective. I like that he's not an idiot and is actually the one who solves the case if memory serves. I'd say that Monti, Brown, Kennedy, Galleani and the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed.Despite this not being as graphic as I'm used to from a Fulci film that is not to say there aren't good effects. I liked the extreme close-up of Julia's death as we see the knife go into something. The blood is a bit bright, but being from the 70's, I have a soft spot there. I also think that the dream sequences feel like a dream, so credit there. There's also this odd scene with dogs and them being cut open. I'm not entirely sure what is going on there, but it looks great and freaked me out. The cinematography is very well done, but I come to expect that.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack here. I think that we do a really good job with the music and again, I knew it would be when I saw Enio Morricone was listed in the beginning. There's a jazz feel to the film if memory serves and it just fits for what they're going to do. It has a dark feel, even though it isn't as eerie as other music. It just fits and even though I'm a bit biased, I would probably add this to the music I listen to while writing.So with that said, I really enjoyed this movie. It has a story that I didn't see the ending coming as the curves and swerves we get give you the answer, but give red herrings as to who it could be as well. I think that is master filmmaking to be honest as the story isn't the most complex. There is some subtext though that I thought fit. The acting is really good as well. It is paced in a way where I never get bored, despite not a lot necessarily going on. The soundtrack and the effects were solid as well. Overall I'd say this is really good movie and could go up with another viewing now that I know how things play out.My Rating: 8.5/10",True

64927,8 July 2020,monsterhunt-94296,Interstellar (2014),9.0,"Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic, inspired by the likes of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I watched this movie for the first time a while ago, so not every detail is fresh in my mind, but it is very memorable and I have something to say. I think that everybody should watch Interstellar. It is one of those movies that everybody deserves to see in their lifetime. The premise of the movie is that Earth is dying, ""the Blight"" has basically destroyed almost all remaining food sources, with corn really being the last big plant. The movie focuses on Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, an ex-pilot for NASA who is now stuck farming (something he does not enjoy), and his relationship with his daughter Murph. The acting by everyone in this movie is phenomenal, and every relationship is painstakingly crafted. We get a good chunk of time on Earth to set up everything that will happen later in the movie. Eventually, we go into space, where we get some of the most realistic theoretical physics in any sci-fi movie. Everything in space looks amazing, actually the whole movie does. Christopher Nolan used no green screens when making this movie, and it shows, because all the sets are fantastic. The cinematography, tone, directing, and color palette are all perfect here. Everything about the look and feel of this movie is done perfectly. As for the story and screenplay, those are also done wonderfully. Even though this movie is 2 hours and 49 minutes long, it holds your attention for each and every second. You could allow yourself to get confused by all the physics trying to work it all out, but the emotional core of this movie within the story is captivating.That leads me into one of the biggest points about this move, the score. The score for Interstellar done by Hans Zimmer is my single favorite movie score of all time, with First Step basically being my favorite piece of music ever composed. The score fits the movie perfectly and adds so much emotional punch to an already emotional movie. There is one scene that is so emotional, and had me on the verge of tears the first time I saw it. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I don't want to spoil anything, so I apologize if I'm not going in depth, but I think everybody needs to watch it. Even if the big sci-fi physics aspect isn't your thing, it has such a strong emotional core. Some people aren't the biggest fan of the ending, but I had 0 problems with it. My only complaint is some of the characters aren't super developed, but that is such a minor flaw in comparison to how much I love this movie.Interstellar also has some things that could be interpreted about the death of film (***like I said*** everything that could be done practically was done practically, and the movie was shot on celluloid film) and movies being plauged with digital and CGI. I think it's a really fascinating and important message that works well within the film.If you're thinking about watching Interstellar, go in with an open mind, as it actually seems to be pretty hit or miss for most people, but for me it was definitely a hit. Interstellar gets a 9.5 or 10/10, I'd need to rewatch it to decide which.",True

65382,6 May 2020,GiraffeDoor,Benidorm (2007–2018),8.0,"If you had told me this would be a show I'd become a big fan of after I first saw a clip I'd think you were crazy. Seeing a huge man intimidate a child from a swimming pool with a remote control boat that runs amok before getting chastized by an adult wasn't my usual idea of comedy gold.Some people use the term ""disposable entertainment"" negatively. But there was something reliable about an episode of Benidorm. You could watch it in the hotel room, casually in the middle of the week or as part of your weekend viewing.Set in the Mediterranean sun, it was ingeniously simply to just make a show where characters were just always on holiday but yet still find problems.Filled to overflow with rich vibrant comedic characters that came and went and then came back again when needed. Sometimes appearing for a short time before then making a bigger splash. This kept the show fresh and to some extent wasn't really one show but at least two shows on a sort of spectrum that turned from one to another. Hardly any episode can be considered truly bad to my mind because every episode always had a mix of things going on until the final season but i'll get to that...I imagine the show divided into three basic eras. The first three seasons are the vintage period. The show began basically as a satire (is that the right word?) about the British abroad. A rich cultural cross section including the nuclear Garvey family (as stable as a nuclear plant too), the gentrified gay coupe (ah...the 2000s...) , the intellectual man-child with his mother and this is just the beginning all experiencing the highs and lows of the budget vacation; those who wish to travel to sunny Spain and remain locked in a British enclave with nay a paella in sight. When a certain character didn't occur in the next season, you never missed them for long since there were so many more to pick up the slack. You kept getting old friends and exciting new faces.The humour was an intelligent mixture of broad gags and nuanced characterization that always went down smooth (except for when it...didn't, I'll get to that). The plots were engaging and the format of each episode corresponding to the events of a day made the whole thing just feel relaxed no matter what happened.The next few seasons saw a bit of a reshuffle which made me wonder if the best years were behind us but new characters actually became new old favorites. To think Kenneth and Joyce would rise to become the very face of the show.The final four years see a big change (I won't spoil it) but by now we've worked into a comfortable format that is less about sending up the British abroad and just utilizing the excellent characters and it became 50% a workplace comedy with the staff fully integrated into the story lines. An additional workplace element was the misadventures of the staff at the Solana's hair salon Blo and Go in which we get four characters, each initially part of their own separate clique but eventually coming together into a well functioning comedy power quartet.There are so many details regarding the characters and the memorable elements and how they develop over time entertainingly. Wise cracking dad Mick Harvey trying to do right by his family but who keeps messing up, the Elderly Swingers who could fill a risque desk calendar with the thing they say, Mateo, the ""greasy barman"" who goes from negative cultural stereotype to a cultural stereotype who became a premier character. I also liked how Tiger went from trouble maker to really maturing to being a sympathetic youthful presence in the show.I've rewatched this, in fact, much of it twice. There's enough of it to just binge on it shamelessly. Though I must say it nice to be able skip some not so choice moments. Namely, a lot of yelling and things getting lavatorial.The show kept a consistent quality for 9 consecutive seasons but sadly it was the tenth that really crashed. I only noticed this on rewatching, but it doesn't quite work and I think the reason for this was the type of stories they were telling. The frustrating misunderstandings of Rob, his girl and his family were just pulled from a hundred cliche family sitcoms and let's face it: Rob and Cyd are perfect for each other because they are incredibly bland characters. This storyline and Monty's trouble with Sammy Valentino are stories that might work very well as a single episode of something but the aforementioned format of each episode corresponding to the events of a single day meant that these below average stores just got way too much air time. I think they expected a new season but ultimately the final episode is one of the worst final episodes of any show. The absence of Jodie (she is such a cutie!) was sadly the least of this season's worries. But never mind.This is a show where things get super silly and then occasionally super serious but not for too long. Relationships are tested, forged and strengthened. I will say this also for the show: you will see people at their lowest and their highest. It makes an effort to reward the viewers that stick with it. I had tears in my eyes during the Pauline storyline, perhaps the most poignant character in the whole show by a strange turn. They play her alcoholism for laughs (ah...the...oh wait that was this decade) but ***like I said*** it gets both serious and funny. You'll know the moment I'm talking about when you see it.I think this maybe could have recovered and given us one more GOOD season but I'm just glad we got so much of this.",True
65495,6 May 2020,arne-54177,Mrs. America (2020),10.0,"In most political tv-dramas ala West Wing there are the good sympathetic side, the pragmatic middle-ground and the evil/greedy/malicious adversaries. Not here. You will at times feel sympathy for both Cate Blanchetts complex portrayal of Shaftlys campaign against the women's liberation movement and disgust at the Pro-ERA proponents that ignore, undermine and fragment themselves in the fight for true equality between the sexes. The conversations are realistic ""-Have you read Xs new unamed book? -No. I hear it is boring. -She is always a bore -"". Events that we tend to think were front and center in the 70s are not dominating the narrative. Watergate, Vietnam and hippies are not shown to be the centre of the world ***like in Forrest Gump, rather they are mentioned*** briefly in passing conversations. Things that were way more discussed then but nearly forgotten today, like SALT and the awkward situation with the political parties in mid-shift is prominent. The conservatives and liberals are not synonyms to the respective parties. We meet the progressive republicans and the chauvinistic democrats. Kudos for showing that. Roe vs Wade is not shown to be the giant battle we think it was today, but rather we are treated to the more bipartisan support it enjoyed. ERA is not shown to be a life or death struggle with a small group of women standing up for it, rather a manifestation of a beginning culture war. There are no heroes, no easy answers or giant victories. This could have been a Wicked witch Shcaffly vs Saint Steinem series. It is not. We see Steinem avoiding picking sides, pedantic infighting, racial unspoken tension, the emergence of lgbtq-struggle, a wide range of christian views from the new evangelicals to the practical pragmatic Catholic mother who shield her gay son in Scafflys case. I love it. Because it does not try to dumb a complicated era down, rather we are shown an era were having a mailing list of 30 000 people was considered a major political asset... and where by-then-standard progressive women still considered it their duty to drive the daughters to tennis-lessons so their husbands could succeed... Where married women debating without their husbands present on television was strange. I am captivated( and also a man), in a way I have not been since Rome was premiering on HBO.",True
66467,17 December 2008,chipe,Decision at Sundown (1957),8.0,"**********spoilers*********** Don't be mislead by my many criticisms -- this is a fine, enjoyable, unusual Western. I highly recommend it.The main theme is that an embittered, flawed, Southern Civil War veteran (Scott) reeks misguided revenge on the man who ""stole"" his wife, and in the process accomplishes nothing meaningful for himself but spurs the community to redeem itself and take back control from unsavory forces.What I liked about the film: ¶ good dialog and direction. ¶ good familiar supporting cast. More time is spent with the supporting cast than with Scott, and they are more interesting and complex characters than Scott. I particularly liked Valerie French. She made a clever and unexpected ploy at the end, which tied up everything very nicely. ¶ one cute scene surprised me and deserves particular mention -- when Scott and the town barber argue over whether the barber has time to shave Scott, instead of Scott forcing the barber to attend to him, Scott wisely asks that he be permitted to shave himself. Too bad Scott wasn't as reasonable throughout the movie.My two serious criticisms are: ¶ it was a really bone-headed and dangerous ploy of Scott to announce, the way he did, publicly in church that he was going to kill Carroll by sundown, just as stupid and unnecessary as his forcing the stagecoach drivers to stop and let him off instead of politely asking them to stop, something they would readily do if asked. Fleeing the church in a hail of bullets and ending up pinned down at the stable showed how stupid it was. There had to be a better way to handle the situation -- like paying to have someone read a message at the marriage ceremony. ¶ the bad guys seemed pretty tame and nice (and few, I might add) after the buildup that Carroll ""got the town in his fist and he's squeezing it hard."" The whole point of the movie was for the town to take itself back from the evil elements, but Carroll seemed ***like the nicest character in the movie; it was never mentioned*** what he was doing wrong. The sheriff also seemed pleasant for the most part. Certainly no monstrous evil was shown. (I guess the writers/producers were aware of all of this. Probably they had to have it both ways -- they needed some unnamed evil for the town to redeem itself from, and they also needed to make Carroll and French likable to earn our sympathy (from Scott's misplaced hate/revenge) and let them leave town in peace and dignity.)I'll end with this small point. The direction was good, but I think they should have handled the Beery back-shooting better. When I first saw the movie, not paying close attention, I thought Beery might have been diving for his gun, provoking/justifying the bad guy to shoot him. Actually, he was just casually picking it up upon leaving. I think it should have been directed better. His gun could have been in the middle of the street, and Berry could have been just leaving the eating-place so the gun would not have been a factor at all.",True
66493,20 December 2008,face_of_terror,SWAT: Warhead One (2004 Video),3.0,"This is your typical action movie, starring former kick-boxing champion Olivier Gruner as a SWAT team's leader. The only other well known cast member is Mel Novak, whom i liked very much in this awful movie. The story is full of cliché's, fighting scenes are bad, i mean really bad. David Huey (directed and also wrote this) doesn't seem to know how to use his actors. I mean, he has Gruner, Ron Hall and Gerald Okamura. Ron Hall is known for his martial-arts skills from Bloodsport 2, and Okamura has been in lots of low-budget martial-arts movies. The only one of the three who gets into the fights is Gruner. What a waste.The movie is full of unnecessary idiotic dubbing (Gruner is being dubbed for a couple of minutes), some parts of the movie were completely dubbed, as if Huey was shooting them with sound turned off. ***Like i said***, the only worthy actor in this movie is Mel Novak. He is actually the only one who is trying to ACT. Everyone else is pretty much awful. 60% of the cast seemed to be picked up from the streets to act in this film.So if you're looking for an action movie, look for something else. Because with this, you will fall asleep in just 20-25 minutes. This is only worth for die-hard Olivier Gruner fans. I bet Gruner really regrets being in this movie.",True
66785,20 December 2008,Spiralup84,Requiem for a Dream (2000),3.0,"I'm sorry, I simply must chime in here. This movie is garbage as far as good junkie movies go. I'm surprised people even lump it in with good and realistic movies like Trainspotting.This entire movie, to me, reeked of the reefer madness of hard drugs. Light on the facts, heavy on the fear and annoying, scary sound effects. The scare tactics used throughout the entire film are pretty obvious and began to wear on me. There was truly nothing notable to me about this film except the constant, recurring feeling that the writer had never touched a hard drug in his life. If he had, then he was going to make sure to blow everything as far out of proportion as possible.I suppose no one will even CONSIDER any sort of psychoactive substance if this is what they do to you. Luckily this is a badly-done dramatization and anyone with eyes and a brain can see that it's rubbish. Maybe he's not going for realism and people are able to give it a pass for its pure artistic value. It's the little things. Take the ""main"" male lead, for example. Every time he shoots up heroin his pupils blow out. Anyone with the most BASIC understanding of drugs knows that the #1 sign of the presence of an opiate is PIN-POINTED pupils. Amphetamines blow out pupils, heroin and opiates cause them to become near pin-points. Nitpicking? On something so basic, maybe not so much. Since they thought it was such a cool feature that they decided to show it EVERY time he got high, then perhaps they should have done the first iota of research and represented the drug properly.It's ***like they took some of the DEA's most promising writers and shoved them in a room and said*** ""Go in and write a movie that will scare the kids sh*t-less against 'drugs' in general, don't worry about the facts.""A couple of things:Permanent amphetamine psychosis? Doesn't really happen...it almost *always* clears up after cessation of use. So the lady going in for electroshock? Pure BS.Being arrested for seeking help at a hospital? Completely ridiculous, and it even sends a DANGEROUS message to kids who may be in trouble.Uneducated kids have DIED because they were afraid they would be arrested at the ER. It's called patient/doctor confidentiality! Misinformation from ridiculous D.A.R.E. FEAR FILMS like this one are the reason some are reluctant to seek treatment. What about the problems caused by the LAW ENFORCEMENT end of the drug problem?The final scene with it's absolutely annoying camera angles and near-snuff-level scenes of people being electrocuted and DYING in jail was enough to make me leave the room. Enough is enough. This movie is awfulThis is nowhere NEAR a good representation of the lifestyle of a junkie. The movie is stuck so far up its own rear when it comes to its message that it loses any potency. The characters are not believable addicts they all bumble around completely depressed all the time and when they are high it is depicted as some manic, terrifying madness.It's as if the person who wrote it had absolutely no clue what the substances actually did to people, so he decided to act as though they were injecting gasoline instead...It makes some valid points, but overall it comes across as a scare-flick made by an anti-drug advocate with an agenda. Sorry if you're one of the many fans of this movie. I saw it once when I was in high school, and now I've seen it again, 7 years later. Two thumbs down, what a piece of trash.",True

The cinematography is just out of this world. And just when you think you got the plot all winded up your finger the thread spins right off and the movie takes a MASSIVE turn. Like holy the fact that the old maid came back was weird but when her fricking husband was just chilling in the basement.... DAMN. The script is just so gorgeous and detailed. The way were everything is planned out, the way it should be with a good movie. Each line fits perfectly in every scene and everything is so balanced out. From the beginning of the movie i felt like everything had already fallen into place. The actors are so good. Obviously i'd never heard of them but omg... so good. You should really watch those cheesy videos about '10 things you've missed in...' but in this movie it's actually really interesting. ***Like the part where there is always a slight 'line' in shots between the wealthy and 'poor' people, which makes sense to the line that the rich dad said*** 'he always seems to cross the line but ends up to just not do it..' It's a small detail but when you pay attention to it it all starts making sense. Or the realisation point in the end where Kim was now hiding in the basement was so mesmerising.

68185,9 September 2013,TheLittleSongbird,Our Mutual Friend (1976),10.0,"Even if the adaptation didn't work, anybody who does try to adapt the work of Charles Dickens deserves a brownie point for trying. Dickens is not easy to adapt, and the bigger and richer the book the more complicated it gets to adapt it. Our Mutual Friend, like Bleak House(which if remembered correctly is even bigger), is one of those examples. And fortunately this 1976 adaptation is an example of Dickens being adapted very well, same goes for the 1998 adaptation.One of the things that was so good about Our Mutual Friend(1976) was its atmosphere, done in a way that is both compellingly real and powerful. It is true that the 1998 adaptation has a better contrast between the rich and the poor, but the atmosphere there didn't quite feel as powerful as it did here. The costumes and sets are beautifully produced and natural, not too clean or stage-bound and the camera work is splendid and stylish throughout, never once showing its age. The music at the start is appropriately brooding, and from then on it really fits the atmosphere and moods of each scene, and if a scene needs an intimacy it's either used sparingly or not used at all.For any film or TV series to adapt source material, it should not only be a solid adaptation(and this doesn't mean word for word, true in spirit works just as well) but work on its own too. Our Mutual Friend(1976) does wonderfully at both. There are a few omissions but essentially this adaptation is very detailed- it was great to see some scenes that were not there in the later adaptation- and faithful in spirit. As well as told intricately and compellingly, with stately dignity. The dialogue is rich in flavour with moments of elegant comedy and heartfelt tragedy, done in an intelligent way and it is Dickenesian all over. As with other BBC adaptations from a similar period of Dickens' work, the series is long and quite lengthy with some slowness but considering the length of the book that is appropriate.Excellent performances also help, and Our Mutual Friend(1976) has them. You can never go wrong with Leo McKern, Warren Clarke does besotted and chilling brilliantly and John McEnery's restraint and quiet authority more than compensates for that he is too old for the role. Lesley Dunlop is an appealing and appropriately honourable Lizzie, she doesn't play her as too meek ***like Dickens heroines can fall into the trap of being(to me how he wrote*** his female characters was Dickens' weak point). Nicholas Jones has a conflicted character and portrays him very touchingly. Jane Seymour plays the unpleasant and selfish character of Bella very convincingly as well as making her somewhat attractive too, it helps that Seymour was a beautiful woman and actually still is. Silas and Ridderhood and are also beautifully played and true to Dickens' concept if a little more convincing in the later adaptation. In fact everybody from the lead roles down to the minor roles play their parts well.All in all, a really fine adaptation and recommended without hesitation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",True

I'm writing this review from memory of the last time I watched it - several years ago. ***Like I said*** in the previous review, this episode did not appear on television reruns - that's how controversial it was!This is a harsh episode. There's no feel good - not ""and they all lived happily ever after"" - no laughter. The entire two-part episode is very dark.After Alice dies in the fire, Andy is trying to come to terms. He needs his father more than ever but Jonathan is drowning his sorrows in the bottle so he won't have to feel. Andy is so stricken with his father's actions that he comes to the Ingalls. He doesn't want to go home - he begs to stay with them. Charles, of course, goes to give Jonathan some tough love. He cannot stand how Andy's being treated. Alice is dead but Andy is very much alive and needs his father more now than ever before!Mary is in a sort of trance merely living and humming the lullaby she always hummed to her baby. But when Albert brings in a music box, she goes crazy. Adam cannot control her. She throws her arm through a window and tears her arm up pretty bad. There's even a point when Adam doesn't think their marriage can stay together. I cannot even begin to imagine what it would be like to have your child taken away in such a horrible way. You can hear his cries as you sit there helplessly not being able to help him. I can't say that I wouldn't go crazy too. I respect how the writer's wrote Mary's part. I believe it is truly close to how some of us would behave if the same thing happened to us. I feel sorry for Mary - why she got all the difficult things - blindness, miscarriage, and her baby taken in a fire in front of her ""eyes"" are only a few things. Laura later looses a baby, but it's not nearly as dramatic.Albert is overcome by guilt and runs away to go live with his father. upon learning of it, Charles takes off to go after him. Jonathan goes with him. My favorite part is the scene between Jonathan - the man who lost his wife in the fire, and Albert - the one who caused the fire. Jonathan could have hated Albert for what happened. Instead, a heart-wrenching, tear-jerking scene of sorrow and forgiveness is beautifully written.The episode ends in complete silence.",True
68343,9 September 2013,dee.reid,Sharknado (2013 TV Movie),8.0,"In sunny Los Angeles, California, it's raining sharks!As ridiculous and impossible as it sounds, SyFy has really managed to outdo themselves, and not in a particularly good, campy way. 2013's Anthony C. Ferrante-directed SyFy shark-fest ""Sharknado"" has become a bona-fide pop culture phenomenon, after the movie ignited an enormous media sensation on Twitter during - and after - its July 11, 2013, premiere, and even subsequently prompted limited theatrical releases all across the country not long afterward. The problem is, at least from what I can tell, is that ""Sharknado's"" surprise success is unique to this film only, and is not likely to be repeated any time soon (perhaps not even with its proposed 2014 sequel, the aptly named ""Sharknado 2: The Second One"").In other words, the success of ""Sharknado"" was a fluke, probably because it's more ridiculous and inane than most of SyFy's usual fanfare. I say this because I've seen more than my fair share of SyFy's usual offerings, which are many times god-awful (though I'll express a fondness for ""Jersey Shore Shark Attack"" and ""Tasmanian Devils""). ""Sharknado"" has grudgingly earned a spot as the best film SyFy has put out yet, but only because of the media sensation it's stirred up in recent months, which is why I gave it an ""8"" - the highest rating I've ever given a SyFy ""original"" picture.There really isn't much of a story, but I'll try anyway: In Los Angeles, the city is suffering the effects of Hurricane David, after the storm ravaged parts of Mexico and is now moving north up the California coastline. Now I'm no meteorologist, but I don't think hurricanes occurring in the Pacific Ocean can travel anywhere except in a western or northwestern direction. Add to that, I've never heard of a hurricane making landfall anywhere on the American West Coast. And I've definitely never heard of a hurricane flinging sharks around in the air and then depositing those same man-eating sharks to dine on unsuspecting Los Angelenos.In the thick of it, famed surfing legend Finley ""Fin"" Shepard (Ian Ziering) attempts to locate, and escort to safety, his various estranged family members - who include his ex-wife April (""American Pie"" series regular Tara Reid) - who are spread out in various parts of Beverly Hills and Van Nuys and they must also brave rising flood waters and the carnivorous sharks that the massive storm has also washed ashore. He's joined by his Tasmanian best bud Baz Hogan (Jaason Simmons), sexy waitress Nova Clarke (Cassie Scerbo), and local drunk George (John Heard).That's about all there is to be said about this film's ""plot.""Until then, you have to deal with the ludicrous premise and gory shark attacks, and occasionally very stupid one-liners (""It must be that time of the month again,"" Baz says, after a shark has just dined on April's new husband). In watching the over-the-top gore in this flick, you can't help but crack a laugh here & there - mostly at the absurdity of everything that's going on. It appears that no one took the premise of ""Sharknado"" seriously (though I've heard in some venues that the filmmakers did take everything they put here on-screen SERIOUSLY and all I ask is, ""Why?""). And how could they? Even the script by Thunder Levin is too ridiculous to be truly believable. You turn your brain off for 90 minutes and just enjoy the fun, but bumpy ride.I know it sounds like I'm giving ""Sharknado"" a bad review, but I'm actually not. What surprises me is that the movie has become a bona-fide pop culture sensation, even if it was an accident. I think it deserves it, for better or for worse; most cult classics don't happen overnight (but this one did). I think it was bound to happen at some point. But why didn't it happen to ""Jersey Shore Shark Attack"" or ""Tasmanian Devils,"" two films that are way better in terms of sheer entertainment value (and nothing else)? But, ***like I said***, it was bound to happen sooner or later, for better or worse, and it just had to happen to ""Sharknado.""P.S.: And also worth noting - and to be expected - are the various references to ""Jaws"" (1975).8/10",True
68532,4 September 2013,StevePulaski,Hard Candy (2005),9.0,"Hard Candy has the impact to be one of the most disturbing pictures a person has ever seen. The strange thing about that is that the film is not graphic, there's no sexual content whatsoever, and there are far, far more violent and vulgar films out there to scar curious viewers. What makes Hard Candy such a pulsating, disturbing movie experience? Writer Brian Nelson and director David Slade craft the film aesthetically off of tense situations and unsettling camera-angles, along with very strong, verbose dialog that will make you a restless viewer. The result is an experience that possesses a Hitchockian effect - fear what's coming; what's not yet arrived.The film has two characters, a rather short runtime, and two settings and manages to be more fascinating than your average dozen-person, two and a half hour long thriller. Ellen Page plays fourteen year old Haley, a girl who frequents chatrooms to talk to Jeff, an older male in his early-thirties. The film opens with a quickly-paced online discussion between the two in a chatroom which leads to a meeting at a local cafe. They talk for a while; she is clearly interested, he is, maybe, subtly aroused, and they head back to his home for screwdrivers and some private fun.She winds up spiking his drink and he wakes up tied to a computer chair. She claims to know he is a pedophile and has a record of mistreating and manipulating young girls. Her goal is to put him through the same physical and mental pain he allegedly brought on many girls right around her own age. If he screams, she resorts to spraying his mouth with some sort of clear liquid (perhaps cleaning solution), and if he tries to escape, he will be met with blunt force. However, this is a shockingly brutal movie solely because of the conversations Haley and Jeff have with each other in Jeff's home, which looks nothing like the archetypal home of a eerie man. No obsessive pictures plastered on walls, no dimly lit, brick fortress providing little light, and no cheap tube TV with a couch sitting in the glow of it. Just an avid, middle class man's home.The commonality gives off the idea that perhaps Jeff is really a normal guy, however, Haley's got almost indisputable evidence against this notion. So onward we watch, as Haley continues to torture and manipulate Jeff, and we, as the viewer, begin to experience odd tendencies ourselves. I can see viewers finding a serious conflict on who to side with in the film. Should we side with Haley because she is theoretically torturing a man who is inhumane and truly perverted, or should we condemn her because two wrongs don't make a right. I'm likely not alone in saying I had serious sympathy for Jeff's character during some parts of the film. My feelings of sympathy were quickly followed by feelings of personal loathing, questioning why I had sympathy for such a person. Such feelings repeated until the film was over and casually poked at me throughout the rest of the day.Because of this reason, many will find the film to be of low quality or mistake its shocking aspects as a point of criticism. On the contrary, if a film can get under your skin the way a film ***like Hard Candy can - through almost intrusive ways - something must be said*** about the quality of its material. Material that is only elevated by such great leads as Page and Wilson, who bring new dimensions to the teenage girl and the creepy thirty-year old. Page knows how to make manipulative and dictative something to root for, while Wilson's seemingly despicable character be made into a slightly-sympathetic one is equal parts offputting as it is true acting talent. To humanize and paint a sympathetic portrait of such a heartless, irredeemable stereotype is the biggest achievement of his acting career thus far.Director Slade, as mentioned, makes Hard Candy very heavy in the stylistic-camera-work department, particularly utilizing closeups and very distinct camera-positions to either heighten vulnerability or power in a character. It's filmmaking 101, but here, the bare-basics feel fresh and subversive due to the fact that they are used to accentuate their purpose to the fullest effect. Rarely have the elements of filmmaking and film shots been so purposeful this early on in the film. Slade, combined with writer Nelson's effective slowburn techniques, make Hard Candy nothing but memorable.Year after year, American audiences see many horror films, many of them featuring women being brutalized, victimized, and murdered. This is not to pull up a sexist debate, but just to pull up a fact in the face of horror cinema. Along comes this film where the roles are reversed, and the film still packs in a wallop of significant proportions. Hard Candy is one of those rare cinematic endeavors where nearly everything it tries to do works, and what little doesn't work for it (IE: the expected escape attempt at the end) is almost as quickly forgotten as it is introduced.Starring: Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson.

Some filmmakers surprise, Last year we had one surprise in the name of Vicky Donor which was least expected to be such a rage, It made Ayushman Khurana and Yami Gautam stars and also brought to the fore a novel concept and a superb director Shoojit Sircar This time too he teams with the producer John Abraham and brings yet another hitherto explored subject. The film is a political thriller which shows the Problems in Sri Lanka against the Tamilians. The film doesn't resort to normal commercial mandates, but is treated like a Hollywood thriller, no songs, no forced romance, comedy Just focus is on the main story. The film moves at a quick speed too and one has to pay attention throughout. There are several scenes which are astounding like the scene where John is confronted after the death of his colleague, or the way the suspense unfolds, the climax....there are several superb scenesDirection by Shoojit Sircar is amazing There's only 1 song towards the end and it's good Camera-work is outstanding Background music is amazing.John Abraham often criticised for being wooden surprises everyone, he has done it before too in No Smoking and many films but somehow people like nitpicking his flaws as an actor, In this film he gets into the character and is perfect for the role. He also should be praised for picking a different subject as a producer/actor. Nargis Fakhri last seen in ROCKSTAR where she was criticised here she does a good job, Perhaps because she has to speak in English and her voice isn't dubbed ***like in Rockstar, that said***, even her acting has improved. The film consists of a list of unknown faces or actors who are seen in films but not much noticed that is an advantage Rashi Khanna as John's wife Ruby is natural, Siddharth Basu is amazing Ajay Rathnam as Anna is amazing,Prakash Belawadi is simply superb in the role of John's head in Jaffna, rest are all good Sp.Mention must be of the actor who plays Rajiv Gandhi he is apt",True
68583,28 August 2013,Hellmant,You're Next (2011),9.0,"'YOU'RE NEXT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another home invasion flick, this one is from filmmakers Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett. The two have teamed together on a number of other horror films including 'A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE', 'WHAT FUN WE WERE HAVING', 'AUTOEROTIC' and segments in the anthology films 'V/H/S', 'V/H/S/2' and 'THE ABCS OF DEATH'. Wingard once again directed and edited the movie and Barrett wrote it. This slasher flick revolves around a family having a reunion at their vacation home (out in the middle of nowhere) when they're attacked by ax-wielding (and crossbow shooting) killers. It stars Sharni Vinson (an Australian beauty known for sequels ***like 'STEP UP 3D' and 'BLUE CRUSH 2'), Nicholas Tucci, Wendy Glenn, Rob Moran, Barbara Crampton, Margaret Laney, filmmaker Ti West (who also wrote*** and directed segments in 'V/H/S' and 'THE ABCS OF DEATH') and a slew of actors from other Wingard and Barrett films like AJ Bowen, Joe Swanberg, Amy Seimetz, L.C. Holt and Lane Hughes. If you've seen Wingard and Barrett's work before it's everything you'd expect from them; nothing but exceptional grade A horror entertainment.The film all takes place at the Davisons' remote vacation house. Paul and Aubrey Davison (Moran and Crampton) are celebrating their wedding anniversary and their three sons and daughter (all adults now) have joined them (with their significant others). The reunion gets off to a rocky start as two of the sons engage in a heated argument, at dinner, when things become even more crazy as the family is attacked by masked murderers (carrying axes and crossbows). The killers find out they've taken on more than they bargained for when they discover one of the Davison boys' girlfriends (Vinson) has a secret skill.The story isn't too original but the film is creative in the way it delivers it (and there are a few twists; I didn't see the one involving Vinson's character coming and there's another big twist at the film's ending). The movie is creepy and brutally violent but also darkly comedic, it's everything Wingard and Barrett have grown to be experts at. Vinson is a gorgeous and likable horror movie heroine and the rest of the cast is all more than adequate in their roles as well. The film, like all great horror movies (and good movies in general), is just a great collaboration. This is a skill that all quality movies depend on but it's something the horror genre is especially good at because horror filmmakers (as well as cast and crew) are a lot more supportive of each other. I once saw an interview with director Eli Roth in which he said horror filmmakers are like 'one big family' and way more supportive of one another than any other genre. They see one filmmaker's success as a success for all rather than as competition. This really shows in great horror movies as it's more than apparent in this film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JQ4A-I9-JM",True

69209,17 February 2016,thesar-2,Sicario (2015),9.0,"Maybe the reason Sicario didn't do so well at the box office or nominated for more deserved Oscars, such as Best Screenplay, Acting and definitely, Picture, was because of how bad the title is. I can barely pronounce it, unless I look at it, or even remember the title. In fact, when I went to go to recommend this at work today to my friends after seeing it for the first time last night, I had to Google it each time.I get what the word means: hired assassin, and it does, very appropriately, fit into the movie. But, that doesn't stop it from failing to get the great word of mouth it truly deserves. I mean, c'mon people; this is a great movie!From moment one, the movie looks gorgeous. It's so beautifully and carefully shot, it better win one of the (only, gasp!) three awards it was nominated for: Best Cinematography. What further grabbed me was the story began in Chandler, Arizona, a Phoenix suburb close to where I work, of all places, and not the obvious choice of Arizona's largest city and capital, Phoenix, itself. That's so cool.Beyond the location and immediate intrigue – this movie wastes no time getting into an extremely interesting story, the high quality acting and direction are immediately present. Emily Blunt blasts onto the screen with a character and acting ability that makes us quickly emerge into her world. Blunt's FBI agent, Kate Macer, is recruited by some incredibly confident ""secret government agents"" that convince her she'll be helping them catch the drug lord(s) who are terrorizing her home of Phoenix (and suburbs) especially after the location mentioned above – a Chandler, Arizona home – practically blows up with a trap set by the drug bad guys.Not without a conscience, Kate is baffled on how the real war on drugs is fought and alongside her even more suspicious partner, she questions and attempts to do the right things to get convictions and build cases against the czars while her new leaders pretty much act all Jack Bauer in Mexico and here against the baddies.There's more, much more, as this onion gets pealed, and I'll leave all that up to you to see for yourself. As you should. In fact, go seek out this movie now and see the greatness for yourself. This movie is absolutely intense and raises so many ethical questions. It's easy, and common, for me to say, YES, do law by the book. Heck, I even have previously built a case against the vigilante, The Batman, on how he always breaks the law every time he leaves the Bat-Cave. But, all the way through this, and seeing the grotesque scenes in Mexico, I found myself sometimes siding with the ""Super-cops"" Kate is internally battling and at other times, agreeing with Kate's morals. Now, without giving away the ending, but keeping with the same point, I have to wonder if I chose the right side. That said, or not said I guess, I LOVED the ending. Even though the movie is fiction, we're usually left with the twist and ironic ending. No, I don't usually like those, but generally respect the writers for doing what they thought right. THIS was how I wanted it to end and made it all the more enjoyable.Definitely should've used a different title. I bet that would've gotten the word out more and more people would've seen such great efforts all around.***Final thoughts: My friend and professional movie critic named this as his favorite movie of 2015 and called it the horror police procedural ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (summing up his words.) Well, ***like I stated*** above for the title, I've never heard of it, but taking both his word on the best of 2015 and him comparing it to my favorite movie of all time, The Silence of the Lambs, I had to see it. And yeah, it was kinda like The Silence of the Lambs. Totally can see that. So, thank you, Kevin. Glad I finally listened to you.",True

I am not a fan of The Beach Boys at all even though I recognize all their songs when I hear them somewhere, like most people do I guess. So it was interesting to watch a movie about The Beach Boys and in particularly Brian Wilson. I had absolutely no clue about his personality because ***like I said*** I never really followed this band. But I certainly did enjoy Love & Mercy. All characters are beautifully played by their respective actors. John Cusack is really good in his role playing the psychotic Brian. The younger Brian played by Paul Dano is also a joy to watch. Same for Elizabeth Banks playing Melinda Ledbetter as the girl that falls for Brian and that tries to get him out of the hands of Dr. Eugene Landy. Dr. Eugene Landy played by Paul Giamatti is a character you feel intense hate for from the beginning till the end and Paul Giamatti plays that character very well. The movie might be long but in fact it seemed over before I knew it. It's very entertaining and pleasant to watch. I'm glad I saw Love and Mercy and that now I know more about the story of The Beach Boys and Brian Wilson. Even if you're not really a fan of the Beach Boys it's certainly worth a watch.",True

We didn't need a plot, because: REASONS Nothing really made sense in this film, outside the fact that the lead antagonist was clearly insane.The ""violence"" and ""brutality"" of this movie was very boring and simple.

However when it comes to the humor it starts to fall down, Wilfred has a very direct kind of humor and will only really appeal to people with a sick and twisted sense of humour (like myself) and that could turn people off and the acting is not all that great with the exceptions of Jason Gann who plays Wilfred and Elijah Wood who plays Ryan who give funny and sometimes charming and touching performances.

I'm telling you to just go watch it. This movie was indeed very different than the cartoon but it also had all the characters and many nearly identical scenes to the original movie. Other than that, there is a kind of version of Mushu in the film that is summoned by the father the same way he did when mushu was sent by the ancestors. The difference is that he is a Phoenix instead of a Dragon and he does not speak. He guides Mulan throughout her journey and empowers her. Mulan is also a lot more powerful in this film than in the original. She is the one to reveal her own true identity to her men because she felt she needed to embrace the virtue of truth in order to fully embrace her power. She isn't caught like in the original. As far as music goes? Absolutely not. That would have completely ruined this film. The tone of this movie is a bit more serious than your typical Disney live action remake. It's a war movie. It has its light hearted moments but the overall tone is serious. There is one scene where they speak the lines to one of the songs. The score includes the original music but no singing. The stunts and fighting in this movie were also extremely good. There were stunts in this movie done on horseback I've never seen done before. As a general rule I don't think Disney really shows blood in any of their movies and even though this movie is very violent, you never see any blood. The fighting and scenes of dead soldiers could be quite frightening for little ones so be careful about watching this one with very young children. ***Like I said***, this IS a war movie with a few brutal fight scenes where many people are killed.

71286,4 September 2020,Horst_In_Translation,Immer wieder anders (2014 TV Movie),2.0,"""Immer wieder anders"", which means something like ""Always differently"" is a German television film from 2014, so this one is already over half a decade old now. It runs for 1.5 hours as they usually do and was directed by Austrian filmmaker Matthias Steurer and written by Sophia Krapoth. The director is more prolific than the writer here as he has already been part of the industry since the early 90s and Krapoth ""only"" started in the new millennium. I would also say his body of work is not just bigger, but also slightly better. That does not say a lot though because it is mostly due to Krapoth's being packed with projects of a really low quality. It is pretty ironic that the production company's name here includes the word ""relevant"" while the visual effects company includes the work art. This film is quality-wise definitely the exact opposite artistic relevance. A lot of make-believe here for sure. But I will talk about the weaker moments later on. Only had to mention this. It's not a really old film or anything, but I'd say that it still should not be shown anymore these days, but then again they are still showing equally bad films from 2005 or so on national television on ARD and its smaller stations, so I am definitely not surprised this one we have here was on yesterday and today. It certainly has nothing to do with quality,just easy to show cheap reruns while cashing in on the audience and literally forcing them to pay for it. Double-digits that is. Shameful. Stand up against this. Okay, drifting away now, so back to this film: Let's take a look at the cast now: The male lead is Barnaby Metschurat, who was quite a rising star early in his career as I remember, not so much anymore now in the 2020s. Or 2010. Female lead is Katharina Wackernagel. She was in her mid-30s when this was made, Metschurat already 40, so not too young anymore. The supporting cast has some familiar names and faces too. Sebastian Bezzel is an actor I like and I feel pretty bad for him that he has to play such a character here, who really deserves better because let's be honest, he is three leagues above Wackernagel, but of course she does not wwant to marry him. Yeah, right. And if you think that is absurd already, wait till you see the gorgeous Laura de Boer and we are supposed to believe the male protagonist is ready to leave her for Wackernagel's character. Absolute nonsense. But yeah, I was talking about the cast. Next mention I want to make is Maren Kroymann. Absolute nothing performance and character here, but she is supposed to bring out the big emotions when we find about her character dying. Not gonna work. You have to invest talent and creativity for such a reaction from the audience. It is all so lackluster here. Last mention to Kim Riedle. She's actually doing really fine right now, scored an unconventional German Film Award nomination not too long ago and seems to be the big exception of a German daily soap starlet who managed a successful film career. Who would have thought. Good for her. But here, her character is so small that once again she cannot make any impact.So I already said a few things about the story and why it is not good at all in my opinion. Another thing that felt really clumsy in my opinion is how this movie spans over many years actually and there are big jumps in time. The story continues when we find out the male protagonist became a dad with his new girlfriend, when we find out his mother died (Kroymann) and so on. It feels really rocky though from a storytelling perspective. Nothing fluent at all. And in the end of course the wedding was cancelled (if it happened in reality only 10% like in the movies... so unrealistic) that would have meant their final farewell as a romantic couple if completed, but yeah we find out in a gooey unauthentic happy ending that they have always loved each other. Okay. So the troubles continue. Oh no, wait. They turn into a happy couple now of course for the next 40 years. This is what they wnat us to think right? Sorry, I can't be doing them this favor. So yeah, the ending is as bad as everything before that. I also did not really like how it was always Wackernagel's character in charge. She decides when her (ex-)man kisses her. She decides when he has to leave first thing in the morning after sex with the ex. Charming. I guess this was supposed to depict her as a confident woman and inspire audiences to be like her because of course the vast majority of viewers here is female. I found it cringeworthy to be honest. And it's nothing new that these ARD afternoon movies frequently have an anti-male message where the female is always the one whose desires matter most and the male characters have to follow them. Of course, equally charming that it is as always the man who is depicted as a cheater here. Sigh. Is there anything positive I can say about this movie? Hardly as you can see from my rating. And it is just two out of ten because I don't give ones. But yeah, Bezzel was okay I suppose, but ***like I said*** I am biased there because I kinda like the actor and especially his crime comedies. This film here is also a comedy according to imdb. A romantic comedy maybe? There are certainly also dramatic moments here. Some I mentioned. But let me assure you that this film is never funny whatsoever and did not make me smile once. Not sure if they tried though and if this can really be called a comedy. But the one thing this film did from beginning to end is take itself completely seriously while not even offering 10% of the talent that would have allowed them to take all this seriously. It's a mess. Oh yes, another positive thing: de Boer's looks as I already said and this is really the biggest absurdity why anybody would want Wackernagel's character over de Boer's. Sigh. Also admittedly I am biased here as I have seen Wackernagel in many other movies and honestly I think she is an actress without the slightest ounce of talent, the slightest ounce of range and versatility in her body. It may sound harsh, but I think it is true. Maybe she has recognition value, maybe her physical shape fits in nicely this time and age, but acting she cannot and she should not play lead characters whatsoever as she has done for years. Hardly any different face expressions through the entire film. Metschurat is slightly better, but not much I'd say. Not too much to say about him. Not a fan, but I have not seen too much from him. Finally, one scene that summarizes this film very well, namely the cringeworthy moment when the protagonists' son turns (professional) life into living hell for a new teacher and Wackernagel's character (of course very confident) stands up for her and not for her son. So yeah, she is also just of course and unbiased. Something that applies in pretty much all her films. Nothing new here. The same old nonsense. Big thumbs-down for this film. At times unbearable to watch, in its better moments still entirely forgettable. Highly not recommended.",True

71914,4 September 2020,Horst_In_Translation,Blade Runner (1982),8.0,"""Blade Runner"" is a film of which at least everybody has heard the title on one occasion or the other and many, many people have seen it too if we take a look at the amount of ratings here on imdb. It is from the year 1982, so it will soon have its 40th aniversary and maybe this happened already depending on when you read my review. It runs for minimally under two hours and is based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, who sadly died of heart failure only months before this film got released. The two writers in charge of the screenplay here were Fancher and Oscar nominee Webb Peoples and both are still alive in their 80s now. But the big name here is of course director Ridley Scott, who has worked on many big movies over the course of his really long career, but the fact that this one here is a massive contender for being his biggest career success still says it all about the film's popularity. The one person where this is probably not a contender for most popular film is lead actor Harrison Ford, but this is only because he was also a crucial player in the Star Wars franchise. And let's not forget about Indiana Jones of course. I have never been a big fan of either and consequently also not a big fan of Ford, but he was alright here. The fact that he does not necessarily play a very likable man as I would say is kinda explained at the end. But I will get to that later. First, a few more words on the cast: There are many cast members in smaller roles that I am not familiar with, even if they are/were also prolific actors. But one mention goes out to Sean Young, who plays the maybe most interesting character from this film. Easily the most stunning though I would say. Daryl Hannah's character is called ""perfect"" on one occasion by another character, but I could not disagree more. Young is perfect here in my opinion. Then again, I have always had a soft spot for dark-haired girls, so certainly biased here. So I mentioned Hannah now, she was very young here of course and most people are also familiar with her from the Kill Bill films and I must admit I did not even remember she was in this film here although, especially with the makeup, her character here is pretty memorable and interesting too. The scene right before the fight when she is in disguise in a similar manner like Bond going against Scaramanga was nice too, but Ford/Deckard is too much of a professional to not spot her quickly, even if he is still taken by surprise by her. Edward James Olmos, another very established actor in here, also plays an interesting character who kind of could have deserved his own film too. And last but not least, Rutger Hauer. Sadly he passed away not too long ago, but this film is maybe his most iconic performance and with the twist towards the end, I can totally see why. He is strong, he is ruthless, but he is much more than that. I will elaborate a bit on that in the next paragraph. Just one more thing here about the main character and his love interest. We see the two leave eventually and it's not safe to say if others will be on their tails, on her tail especially, but the scene with the little thingey on the ground in the end implies that they may have gotten help from the Asian guy, who made it look as if she was dead, so nobody will know she is still alive and on the run. Actually, a strong premise for a sequel too and that sequel came, but no less than 35 years later and I must say I did not like the sequel at all, maybe because I hadn't seen or wasn't too familiar with the original, but then again it should never be essential to have seen a film in order to appreciate another. Still, it got Roger Deakins an Oscar finally, so it's good it exists. Also, another interesting thing about the original here is that it is set in 2019 as we find out at the very start, so in the past now as we are in 2020. Always an interesting aspect how people saw the future back then.Okay, now I want to elaborate a bit on the story and scenes and inclusions that I liked the most. Must initially give a brief summary of the premise. Mankind created replicants, man-like creatures that are as smart as the smartest men and stronger than the strongest. And they are very pain-resistent too. On one occasion, they said that the only way to hurt them, is to kill them. However, conflicts arose and war was declared against said replicants who were at distant planets and had to work as slaves. In this movie, six replicants manage to flee and come to planet Earth. Two of them were killed immediately and a bit of a pity that we find out nothing else about those. The other four get decent inclusions though, at least two of them also considerable screen time. The snake woman does not. She is the first who gets found by Deckard and he manages to take her down after a fight. Immediately afterwards, the protagonist runs into the second replicant and is basically caught with his pants down by him (just metaphorically), but luckily an unexpected ally is there to save his life. Two remain. Hannah's character is the third. It is kinda interesting how Deckard takes down one by one just like the Bride does in ""Kill Bill"". Anyway, as for this one here, Hannah is eventually still at her buddy Sebastian's home and that place is indeed very creepy somehow and extremely bizarre with all the lights and of course the mechanical creatures that Sebastian considers his friends. He is a weirdo, but not an evil man. He has no real choice other than helping the replicants. Hauer's character is mostly interested in an idea how he can keep himself alive for more than four years. Or actually cares more about keeping Hannah's character alive. This is how long the replicants have. Not a lot. There is a good quote about a parallel they have compared to light bulbs. And that is why he wants to see Joe Turkel's character and well, of course it is pretty shocking and violent and brutal how the latter gets murdered eventually, but you can make a bit of a point for this being not motivated by hate or anything, but just by hopelessness and desparation against the man who caused this by creating the replicants with a life span of four years and there is no option to have them live longer as we find out while they discuss all kinds of scientific processes.Now, the one thing I want to elaborate on most of all here is the definition of who is the offender and who is the victim. We follow Ford's character and he represents one side here and of course we side with him sooner or later, but at the same time we forget how he was recruited here early on. He had no choice, but was literally forced by his boss to follow his orders. Apparently, he worked for him or for the agency in the past already and he clearly was not happy at all with it back then and just hoped he could get away, but he has no choice. Maybe the one thing missing here a bit is an explanation of why they are called blade runners, but that is just a minimal criticism. Anyway, take a look at how Ford's character shoots the first replicant. She is running from him, trying to be safe, to get away, but gets murdered in cold blood. You can call it that. There is not too much to say about the second victim. Of course, it is another fight about life and death for him. But seeing Hannah's character die is also very telling being in disguise before that and eventually on the ground like a severely wounded animals. That is what the replicants are: Animals. Slaves. But all their violence results from what was done to them and not from being evil or anything. Not at all. Then with Hauer's character, there is the big revelation. Yes he breaks Deckard's fingers, but he does so because his loved ones were taken from him and apparently he also knew that it was not Deckard who killed the other male replicant, so only two fingers. Also pay attention to the hands. Roy (Hauer) easily could have broken Deckard's hand in that situation, maybe torn it off even, but he lets go. And his own hand is very injured. It may be the wildness, the muscles we see as Hauer's character runs around topless that has him appear like a beast to us, but that is what he is, again an injured monster and one who is stronger than the others. He is called the prodigal son for good reason earlier. And when we have that shot outside in the pouring rain with Deckard being in danger of falling to his death, but Roy lends him a hand and pulls him up before dying himself making his last deed an act of mercy shows us that he is not evil and neither are the other replicants. That camera shot from down there pointing up to Roy with the dove in his hand is pretty massive and very memorable, also how he lets the dove go in the moment of his death. Okay, maybe a bit unrealistic that this exact moment the Asian guy is there, but okay. Everything before that was so brilliant that I can accept it. In-between, I had several moments where I thought I could actually give this four stars out of five and not just three and thus declare it as one of 1982's finest, but the final sequence with Hauer's character on the chase was initially a bit underwhelming I felt, so I was hesitant, but the final twist and explanation about goodness, mercy and perspective (***like I said*** in the title of my review) was just too good to be ignored. The film also could have ended the moment Hauer's character died, but the epilogue is also tolerable I suppose, even if it was not necessarily required. Without it, we would have thought that Rachael left and will not be followed and hunted down by Deckard as he owes her. That's what he said himself. But yeah, it's the message about (not just) slavery and about people only wanting the best for them without being evil. Only being heartbroken and disappointed may bring out the worst in them. Or how it matters so much from which perspective you watch a movie in how you perceive the characters. But they are 100% authentic, also showing their ""love"" in front of Sebastian. Watch it!",True

73503,7 May 2020,peytong00,Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986),9.0,"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (originally finished in 1986 but not publicly released until 1990 due to complications with the MPAA) without a doubt in my mind is one of the most controversial, appalling and disturbing films that I have ever seen. Now a little background first, the movie is loosely based off of the real life crimes of convicted serial killer Henry Lee Lucas and his friend Ottis Toole. Now I say ""loosely based"" because Henry has said he's killed hundreds of people, which based on his low IQ I highly doubt, and it's never been truthfully confirmed that Ottis killed anyone so it's a good possibility that he never did, so in that sense the movie may be about as accurate to the real life crimes as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is to the Ed Gein case, but I digress.The movie focuses on the daily life of Henry, who's currently living with his former cell mate Otis and his sister Becky. We find out almost immediately that Henry is a killer as Becky wants to know what he was put away for but Otis refuses to tell her. We find out from Henry first hand that he murdered his mother in cold blood when he was younger, and yet strangely feels no remorse from it, in a way signifying to us early on about his cruel, inhuman behavior.The rest of the movie goes from bad to worse, with Henry only killing hookers at first but then slowly spiraling deeper and deeper into a world of depraved murder and insanity. Personally I think it's a very well crafted and expertly made film. There are long periods without music which really adds to the movies' gritty sense of reality and watching it almost feels like you're witnessing real life crimes, it's truly sickening, but at the same time you can't turn away.I think this movie is very similar in tone to that of Taxi Driver (1976), and along with that film may have been part of the inspiration for Joker (2019), all of which feature a killer who is seemingly normal (though maybe a little awkward) by day but haunt the streets at night, growing increasingly detached from the world of reality and believing that some people are simply not fit to live, and that they actually deserve to die.Now before you go and watch this film I'd like to inform you to proceed with caution, it's quite hard to watch and even harder to recommend due to it's highly disturbing and realistic depictions of murder, rape and dismemberment, definitely not recommended to those who are squeamish, easily offended or faint of heart, and probably shouldn't be viewed by anyone under the age of 17, at least that's my honest opinion. Also be advised this isn't exactly a horror movie either so don't let that turn you away, it's more of a biography, crime, drama than anything, however there are sequences in it that I'll admit are quite horrifying, especially the home invasion video tape scene.Overall a very well done film and ***like I said***, it's one of the most disturbing I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot), so if you're not afraid then go right ahead and watch, just heed my warning it's not a pleasant viewing and has scenes that will surely stick with you for the rest of your life. Thanks and stay safe out there.",True
73563,7 May 2020,second-exodous,The Cokeville Miracle (2015),10.0,"The movie was weirdly made in two parts. I read a lot of reviews before I watched this and an ongoing theme were people upset about the praying in the movie. ***Like I said*** the movie itself is two parts, the factual part and the religious part. I'm not saying the religious part didn't happen, there are a lot of coincidences, but the first hour just tells the story. Up to around the 55 minute mark it is just the events that led up to the explosion and THEN the prayers are mentioned and kids start to talk about the angels. Before the 55 minute mark there is nothing religious besides the cop not wanting to go to church. When the bomb went off I thought it was the end soon and I was wondering if I had downloaded the same movie.So if you are upset by 'religious propaganda' then just watch the first 55 minutes and then stop. The movie itself isn't a high end production, more like a made for TV special, but it is pretty factual. Most of the acting is pretty good, only a few times was a pulled out thinking that was a scripted reaction or whatever. The last 40 minutes or so is where it shows the kids praying and them recounting their visions of Angels and such.",True
73662,7 May 2020,stammastro10,Westworld (2016– ),9.0,"First off, I usually do not watch much sci-fi tv shows. To be honest, I had never seen one and now, while being in Quarantine, I chose to watch this.First and Second seasons were really great.First Season, as someone mentioned, seems like a novel which unfolds episode by episode and the end was completely majestic.Second Season was great, too. I know I know...yes, I was also some kind of confused with those flashbacks every time but COME ON PEOPLE, open Wikipedia, watch videos on YouTube for explanation. There are so many websites that explain each of episode's plot. Whenever I felt confused , that saved me. And It seems that plot of Season 2 was enough good to keep me watch the show.And now we come to Season Three. Ok, hold on. I really did not enjoy Season Three as much as the previous Seasons. I really think, like others, that a bit of ""Westworld"" thing was gone and show emphasis on ""West"". But ok, I didn't focus so much on this. I really wanted to get them out of park, come on...what else remains to do in the Park. Yes, I wanted them to go to the outer world, with that high Technology and see what Dolores is capable of doing and, of course, all of the other characters. But unfortunately...plot was...I can't describe it. NOT GARBAGE. NOT GOLD. It was some kind of "" Yeah, write this...oh, write and this to excite people. Put effects man, effects ! And also, heroes always shoot better, no matter the situation. ""
So, I was kind of disappointed on Season Three. It really had some good scenes but the whole plot usually didn't make sense. Stabs and Bernard were ***like ""We' re gonna stop Dolores"" , ""We' re gonna stop Dolores"" They said*** it in every episode but truly they did nothing...
And now we have William, one of my best characters, that Season Three makes him be like another piece of paper in the plot of the Season, not connected to any of the main parts. Why Producers ?After all, I still love Westworld but Season Three makes me really questioning what else has this show to offer...",True
74119,8 July 2020,monsterhunt-94296,Inception (2010),10.0,"I recently rewatched Inception and, as the title says, it was much better than I remembered. Now, you have to understand, when I first watched Inception it was one of the best movies I've ever watched, so topping that was an accomplishment. This movie has so many layers to it, and the two and a half hours pass by quickly.There are so many great things about Inception. The best way to describe it is a modern classic. Hans Zimmer does a stunning soundtrack, as always, with these loud air horn noises that apparently were written into the script. In recent years this movie, and really Nolan movies in general, have begun to receive some criticism. People are beginning to complain that Inception has too much exposition delivered through dialogue. Now, there probably was some better way of delivering the exposition, but just think about how lost we would all be without it. I didn't fully understand the movie until my second watch, and even then I'm sure there's a thousand things that I missed. For me the exposition passes by quickly and I really don't mind due to how well crafted the rest of the movie is.
The screenplay of Inception is also fantastic. The way the story progresses through the layers of the dream, the fact that it's all so consistent with itself, the fascinating story, the character moments, it makes sense why this screenplay took Nolan so many years to write. The directing, visuals, and editing of the movie all enhance the screenplay and bring this whole thing together. A fantastic example that's been talked about many times over the years is the hallway scene that was all done practically. It blows my mind that they built a spinning hallway and trained actors to do an action scene within it, it shows the incredible lengths Christopher Nolan will go to to make his movies look great. The first time I watched this movie, I didn't realize that this is really a psychological thriller. Inception puts a lot of it's focus, literally, on Cobb's subconscious. Another thing that hit me hard on the second viewing was Fischer's side of the story. The first time, I didn't fully grasp how the whole inception went down. On my second viewing, it was really powerful. They made Fischer convince himself that his father actually loved him and wanted him to be his own man, and that culminated with the phenomenal vault scene. The worst part of all of this is that Fischer's father probably didn't love him, it was all made up. On top of this, Cillian Murphy gives an incredible performance.***Like I've said*** before, this movie works exceptionally well on a rewatch. Most of what I've talked about only became apparent on a second viewing. I'm sure the more I watch this movie the more I'll love it. There's one big part of Inception that really works though, and that's that the movie is just really entertaining. All of the action scenes are intense, the runtime and pacing is perfect, the performances are all wonderful, and the couple of jokes thrown in there get a laugh out of you. You're trying to wrap your mind around the complexity of the story, but it's all so much fun to do. There are some complex movies out there that just aren't as entertaining as Inception, even though they may be smart. I think that's really what still has people talking about it to this day. It's fun to rewatch not only because of the complexity, but it never loses entertainment value.My thoughts on the ending of Inception are that the top stops spinning. Cobb isn't dreaming, but as many people know this doesn't matter. Cobb stops questioning his reality and embraces his kids whether he's dreaming or not. I think that Christopher Nolan intended for it to not matter, but he cut to black to keep the discussion going. As you can tell, people are still talking about this movie ten years after its release, and people are still debating if the top keeps spinning or not. I think the best part of this movie is that Christopher Nolan makes you question reality. The point he was making was that reality is so important to us, and throughout this entire movie, all the action scenes, the beautiful score, the incredible performances, there is one thing we take away. A forever spinning top. The image is burned into our minds, and the real accomplishment is that Nolan managed to perform an inception on the viewers by causing us to question our own reality. For me, the two times I've watched this movie I've had very vivid dreams for a few nights afterward. Nolan made me question my reality. This realization is what made me love this movie even more. One very simple idea, planted in the depths of our mind, exactly as Cobb did to Mal, he spun the top.10/10 masterpiece.My Rating System:1/10- hot garbage
2/10- really bad
3/10- pretty bad
4/10- bad
5/10- meh/ok/fine
6/10- good
7/10- pretty good

74165,8 July 2020,Blk_Ne190,The F**k-It List (2020),2.0,"This movie feels ***like it was wrote*** by a teenager. It is so melodramatic and self pitying, it is a disaster.The main character is just so annoying and I don't even know. The opening scene told me everything about this character. His parents had left him post it notes all over the house because he clearly can't do anything by him self. But apparently he is the best teenager to have ever graced this earth so confusing.There is just so much petulant behaviour it's so bad. He ends up loosing his places at collage because he blew up a school. There is no involvement of the police which once again is confusing. He then proceeds to record the most manic video about wanting to do things he wish he had done.This is just so bratty and spoilt. He takes no responsibility about blowing up a school because he was being a stupid child.Then when he is sad he sits and sulks in his back garden pool. I mean can he be anymore relatable.Everything is just teeny and just oblivious to the real world.The speech at the end. Jesus. It feels ***like it was wrote*** by a child who has been sent to his room after being told off. ""Mom you just don't understand me"". It's just trash.It is 100% made for teenagers but it shouldn't be because it is like telling them to be like ""drop out of college and just fart around doing nothing if you want to"" that is not a good message.In someways it's like a bad version of Booksmart (2019) in ways like he wants to do things he has missed out on doing. But booksmart handles it in such a good way and you like the characters because they are well drawn and thought out.So in conclusion watch Booksmart",True
74500,8 July 2020,blott2319-1,Guns Akimbo (2019),3.0,"In a way you have to admire Daniel Radcliffe's dedication to reinventing himself since Harry Potter. He has made a point of taking a number of odd roles and taking a lot of risks. Unfortunately, sometimes when you gamble you crap out, and such was the case when he ended up in Guns Akimbo. This film is one of those annoying movies that is overflowing with machismo and thinks it is so cool. The whole concept of the film is kind of moronic, but I guess it's supposed to be excused for that because it's not meant to be taken seriously. It feels like they were trying to mock the internet's obsession with the awful things in society, but the writer/director doesn't have the skill to deliver that kind of metaphor with any effectiveness. Instead, he actually indulges all those baser instincts, and makes a movie that totally glorifies them. Even the main character who is a self-professed pacifist who wants to be one man who does his best to make the world a better place, turns on a dime when his ex-girlfriend is in danger and becomes a gleeful killing machine. This movie would have made much more sense if the character was an internet troll himself, rather than a self-righteous ""troll-hunter,"" but perhaps someone suggested to Jason Lei Howden that would make the hero too unlikable. Although, there's some irony there in the fact that Howden himself has turned into a bit of a troll since this movie came out.But there's more wrong with this film than just the failed attempt at making a point. For starters, the comedy is almost all atrocious. Just ***like I said*** that Guns Akimbo gives off the aura that it thinks it is so cool, it also thinks it is so funny. With its quirky characters that say silly and unexpected things, they are trying hard, but I didn't even chuckle. The villains in particular are odd and each have their own unusual way of talking, but I found them tedious and annoying. Plus the ""joke"" of Radcliffe trying to do mundane things with guns instead of hands got old really fast. Another big problem with Guns Akimbo is that it tries to be clever by adding references to how things are in ""the real world"" despite the fact that the entire film takes place in this insane fantasy land. For example, you can't make a point of saying that gunshots are so loud that they make our hero's ears ring after one shot (and would render Rambo deaf) but then later have a character wielding a gatling gun with zero ear protection. You have to pick a lane and stay in it, but this film bounces around constantly and it takes away from the story. Radcliffe does his best with what he's given, and there's a small cameo from Rhys Darby that is the only time I even smiled while watching. The rest of the time I just found Guns Akimbo dumb or depressing. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but I certainly don't want to see it again.",True
74502,8 July 2020,tstudstrup,Bombshell (I) (2019),1.0,"It takes place in 2016 during the presidential campaign. Its very political and its clearly released now, to keep Trump from getting another 4 years in the white house. I hate Trump and he is the worst president ever. However this feminist movie wont make a damn bit of difference. Trump will most likely be re-elected, because the American public are morons and because of electoral college and the whole corrupt political system in America.
But that's another story. Lets get back to the crap that is ""Bombshell""*SPOILERS AHEAD*It takes place on Trumps favorite news station: Fox News. Back then Roger Ailes (an over the top disgusting John Lithgow in a fat-suit) ran Fox News. He offered attractive women on Fox promotions in exchange for sexual favors. In the end he was fired for sexual harassment, based on a lawsuit from a fired woman, who wouldn't have sex with him and won the lawsuit and 20 million dollars.
You have these two annoying leads played by CharlizeTheron and Nicole Kidman (both have had their faces ruined by botox) who wants to take down Roger Ailes. And a very attractive Margot Robbie who is the only one that is actually showsn being harassed by Aisles. And a bunch of other very unattractive women including the ugly Kate McKinnon, known from SNL, playing Hilary Clinton as well as starring in the awful SJW remake of Ghostbusters from 2016.John Lithgow and Margot Robbie are the only ones giving good performances. The rest are a bunch of angry and swearing women who hates Aisles for giving them good jobs and for giving him sexual favors, they themselves agreed to in exchange for those jobs. Nobody forced these women to have sex with Aisles.Therons character who never actually had sex with aisles 10 years ago (she just did the twirl for him) decides to bring him down. After working for the man for 10 years in a highpaid prestigious job. The rest of the men in the movie are pretty much just pushovers, only there, to agree with these angry women.Most ridiculous scene. Therons husband plays tennis and he loses to another guy. The guy walks up to Theron and says ""Trump 2016"". Her husband then threatens to kick his ass iif he ever talks to his wife again. As they leave Theron says to her husband he is getting some action for standing up for her. This is an actual scene. The guy just said he will vote for Trump. He wasnt even threatening Theron.Another ridiculous scene, also with Theron. She reads something in a binder about Trumps opinion about women. She immediately gets sick and runs to the bathroom to throw up. Give me a freakin' break!!Other annoying things: peoples names and titles appear next to them on the screen, Trumps tweets appear on the screen and sometimes these angry women looks directly into the camera in the middle of the scene. This makes the movie feel staged and its hard to tell how much f it is made up, even though its based on a true story.I recommend avoiding this movie unless youre a whipped boyfriend that wants to get some action from your bossy angry girlfriend and then youre forced to suffer through this metoo znooze-fest. If youre a single man just don't watch this. Simply because your balls are still intact.I cant even imagine most women would even enjoy this. Probably only man-hating feminists.And ***like others have pointed out***: if they wanted to do a metoo movie, why didn't they make one about Harvey Weinstein or Jeffrey Epstein? Much much worse predators!!Me and my friend, who struggled to stay awake in the cinema, during bombshell, had not heard much about Roger Aisles and FoxNews. But again this movie is also very political. And maybe they don't have the guts to make a movie about Harvey Weinstein, because that would make Hollywood itself look bad. Which makes them a bunch of hypocrits.",True
76072,21 December 2008,AudioFileZ,Appaloosa (2008),9.0,"This movie is fairly humble in story and scope, and it works very well indeed. You could say that the oft told story of a fledging prairie town preyed on by the evil rancher is too predictable. Be that as it may, you will still likely enjoy this yarn due to the excellent performances of Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen.Ed Harris is the writer/director/star of Appaloosa. Not only does he adapt and direct this western story well, his portrayal of Virgil Cole is excellent. Cole is, perhaps, the greatest living ""gunman for hire"". He specializes in returning lawless towns to justice. He feels he is good at what he does because he never lets feelings interfere with the work at hand. That will change and the mantle will be, more or less, passed to his faithful sidekick Everett Hitch. I'd say Harris casting is pretty ""spot-on"" with one exception that will be addressed shortly. Viggo Mortensen as the loyal Hitch provides the greatest surprise as he almost steals Harris' thunder in a portrayal that begs for a sequel. The casting exception may be Renee Zelweger's character Alison French. For some reason it seems she cannot fully inhabit the character as she is too needy and not dangerous enough as femme fatale type. That said, she is still the undoing of the man without feelings making the dispensing of his brand of justice quite complicated. Overall a good telling of the classic good/evil western with human complications providing twists and turns. There may be those who do not like the ending as it provides a fast resolution. I believed in it and liked it's simplicity as it fit the overall tone of the movie in a good way. ***Like I said***...The character of Everett Hitch works so well a sequel would be nice.",True
76456,22 December 2008,anxietyresister,Blood Trails (2006),1.0,"Don't you just hate it when people in jeopardy behave like morons just to prolong suspense? Take 'Blood Trails', for instance. This film has some of the most stupid behaviour of any potential murder victim I've seen in my life, but first lets concentrate on that title. You'd never guess, but the majority of the action takes places on a biking trail near a mountain, and lots of people get killed on it. Blood. Trails. It has a double meaning. DO. YOU. SEE?? Alas, this is the same level of intelligence the director and writer display throughout, as people make unfathomable decisions and end up inevitably as lifeless corpses. You have allow for a certain amount of leeway in slashers but come on, check out this bunch of howlers:1. If you get the opportunity to escape in a car, take it. Don't try to reverse and run over the psycho, and certainly don't assume that just because you can't see him any longer, he's dead. Or you might just end up with an axe in your fuel tank.2. If confronted with said psycho, do not throw only weapon you have at him because if you miss, you'll be defenceless and prone to attack.3. If the psycho turns his back to you and you happen to find a sharp knife to ambush him with, its usually a good idea not to make a lot of noise as you approach him, for he may just hear you and smack you in the gob, putting you on the floor and halting your worthy effort.4. If you somehow find yourself in possession of a cellphone in the wilderness and you reach a high enough peak in the wilderness to get reception to call 911, you should listen to the advice of the operator to STAY WHERE YOU ARE so they can find you with a helicopter within a few minutes. DO NOT run a mile from your present location just because you see a horrible sight. No, not Sharon Osborne, but your dead boyfriend crucified on a cross with his blood dribbling on you.5. If a strange girl covered in blood enters your vehicle and asks for help rescuing her boyfriend (who has any sane person could work out is brown bread by now) either contact the authorities or drop her off at the hospital. The guy in this film looks ***like he's going to be sensible and do the latter, but without much convincing from our lass in peril he backtracks, then takes his gun and advances on said*** psycho asking him for his credentials. I think you can guess what happens next..6. ..Which brings me neatly to 6, where I must tell you that no fewer than three people in this movie have their guns trained on the psycho at any one time, but somehow he is able to disarm and kill them all with just a lil wee knife. Is he some kind of army Marine? Nope, just a deranged cop who is the victim of a stupid screenplay.7. You're a lumberjack and you're OK. You sleep all night and you work all day. You also never warn people when you're felling trees, you throw around people's bikes when you're in a bad mood, and if your mate gets slaughtered by a psycho you rush over there unarmed like a lemming over a cliff to impale yourself on a sharp object. At least according to this script you do. If you have a union, I think you should sue. Get all copies of this removed from the shelves for misrepresentation. I don't have an ulterior motive, honest..8. Finally, after psycho abducts you, dresses your wounds, feeds you dinner, ties you up, cuts your legs open (you know, the usual) you're maybe wanna going to take some revenge. But this being a E-list horror film, being impaled through the head isn't going to be enough for him, is it? No, only when you've got a shard of glass and stabbed him through the throat with it, then you can relax. And the film ends LITERALLY THAT SECOND. Yay.So, in essence this is a badly directed (Check out all the pointless sped up and black and white scenes) badly acted ( Ben Price's performance as the monosyllabic psycho is laughably unconvincing) badly written (see above) and well, just all round bad really. I wouldn't be surprised if the catering on set was bad, too. Any cast members wanna PM me with complaints about their grub to confirm my suspicions? I hear lots of copies of Robbie Williams's flop Rudebox CD album were buried in a desert landfill somewhere because they wouldn't sell. How's about we fly out every DVD of Blood Trails too and dispose of them the same way? They can keep each other company! Come on now, What d'ya say?????? 1/10",True

They are all loathsome vacuous people, which I'm sure is the point. But i have to agree with the critics for once. Maybe I'm missing something. For other awful films watch, Snakes On A Plane and Wolf. Films i know should be about personal choice and if everyone like the same things in this life then it sure would be a boring place and i know you should never ever really trust one persons point of view, be it movies, music or theatre. But due to the freedom of speech, that we kind of have i will stand up and say that this film is an absolute stinker!!! The acting i felt just left me cold right from the beginning and ***like i have said*** the characters portrayed were just unpleasant to put it nicely.

76529,22 December 2008,MartinHafer,A Christmas Carol (1910),8.0,"For a film from 1910 (or 1907--I found 2 different dates for it), this is an exceptional film, though by today's standards it's pretty poor. Compared to the average Edison production, this one had much nicer sets and costumes and the short length of the film wouldn't have been seen as a problem--all films were rather short in this era. Of course, compared to later versions, this one also comes up wanting in many ways--but for its time it was dandy. As for the problems, you really need to know the story well to follow this version. I assumed audiences of the day must have been well-versed with it but again and again, things happened but because the film was so truncated you only understood it if you knew the story. Also, ***like most versions of the story, the poverty and responsibility to the poor were aspects of the film that weren't emphasized enough--and this was THE reason Dickens wrote*** the story--not just to give us a nice Christmas story.Still, for 1907/1910, this is a well made and watchable little gem that should make fans of early silents happy.By the way, if you wonder why I mentioned the Movie Channel's Bunnies, they are cartoons where an entire film is condensed into 30 minutes. This condensed format reminded me a lot of this version of A Christmas CAROL since it's so very short.",True
76614,22 December 2008,lvburns,Cadillac Records (2008),9.0,"As historically inaccurate as it may be according to others, this is a fantastic film. I'll support this kind of movie-even twice-before any of the ""Quantums"" or other big-bang noisemakers. It is a fantastic film primarily because of the performances and the music. Period. I think the screenwriter and director realized that and got out of the way as much as possible. Characterizations of historical figures is rarely done this well, especially when there is singing and performing on musical instruments involved. First, there is Gabrielle Union as Geneva. I've never seen any of her work that I am aware of and she does not disappoint in any scene here. Columbus Short...same for his work. He carries the chip that must have been on Little Walter's shoulder as if it were his own. Cedric the Entertainer always surprises me with some small characteristic that pops out of the screen and grabs me. Emaunuelle Chriqui...same for her work. I hope to see her in more extensive film roles. I heard an interview with Mos Def who said he wished there had been more of his Chuck Berry ""duck walk"" used in the movie. I have to agree because Mos was great here. I have to agree with other comments here that not only did Beyonce redeem herself here from Dreamgirls, she simply blew the role of Etta James right out of the water. If you watch her sing near the end of the movie and don't feel her ripping right into your soul, you'd better grab a defibrillator. If she doesn't receive an Oscar nomination at least, I will be disappointed. Adrian Brody is outstanding as Len Chess. He provides the fixed sun around which his musical stars gravitate. Finally, there is Jeffrey Wright and Eamonn Walker. Wright is always impressive in many ways; no less here as Muddy Waters, the catalyst for the major upheaval in musical style and expression that has been emulated, but never surpassed, ever since. Wright's performance is as nuanced and subtle as Short's is over the top. I hope this performance is recognized in major ways. And I thought Heath Ledger was a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actor Oscar until I saw Eamonn Walker's Howlin' Wolf. ***Like many of the actors I mentioned*** above, I have never seen Walker's work. His 'Wolf' didn't just Howl, it screamed off the screen in every facial expression and body movement. Man, he was good!",True

I saw him in Vantage Point and wasn't impressed at all but here he has a bigger role and more to do as far as the movie goes.

76638,22 December 2008,Zingbot_9000,A Miser Brothers' Christmas (2008 TV Movie),3.0,"My biggest gripe on this one was not Snow Miser or Heat Miser...it was the other characters in this story. I think they did a decent job with the two main characters, but outside of them everything was beyond terrible. They did not even try to replicate the characters. They all looked different.....much cheaper. The elves for example looked not as detailed...they looked like an after thought. In fact, most of the elves were kids or kids with mustaches. Mrs. Claus looked like that lady from Sylvester and Tweety...you know the granny that hits Sylvester over the head with a cane. Santa Claus......it's hard to describe....he looked like he was from another story...not a Year Without Santa Claus. Mother Nature? The same. Why no Jingle and Jangle? Seriously why do a half attempt. It is almost ***like they were rushing this out for Christmas and said***...oops we gotta get this out in a couple days hurry up design some characters.On top of that, the music was terrible....besides playing the Heat Miser and Snow Miser themes on more than one occasion. They even had Snow Miser sing ""He's Mister Green Christmas"". Then had Heat Miser sing ""He's Mister White Christmas"". Any opportunity to play this song possible. Other than these songs......hardly a thought was given to the music.I did enjoy baby Snow Miser and baby Heat Miser. And seeing both Characters again.It was nice to hear the original Santa and Heat Miser voices included....although both voices where different due to the fact both men are now in their 80's.....especially Santa. I really had no gripes with Snow Miser cast. Everything else...URGH! I ask why they just could not do this right. Make the Characters look at least somewhat like they used to...which means include Jingle and Jangle. Spend a little more time coming up with decent Christmas songs.It hurts me to say this but...........thumbs down.",True
76653,22 December 2008,BloodTheTelepathicDog,Halloween (2007),3.0,"I should have known better. I consider myself a horror film fan, but not a modern horror film fan. The original Halloween, directed by the incomparable John Carpenter, had a mysterious aura to it while this film is basically just another mindless exercise in modern day horror sleaze. Rob Zombie shows his lack of writing skills, utilizing every cliché in the book: from making Michael Myers the son of a redneck stripper and constantly being bullied at school and at home by mommy's dead beat boyfriend. In the original Halloween, Michael was the son of middle class parents, not trailer park trash, creating mystery as to what set the boy off. Here, Rob Zombie offers the viewer no mystery but shows us everything - everything that we have all seen before mind you.I enjoyed Zombie's House of 1,000 Corpses because of its originality and inventiveness, but Zombie just mirrors the latest horror sleaze trends in this film. The babysitters, the focal characters in the original, aren't even introduced until a third of the film is over, and when they are introduced, you won't like a single one of them - not even Laurie Strode. It is clearly Zombie's desire to have the film viewer sympathize with Michael, a murderous psychopath, since he doesn't offer us a single heroic character to pull for. Someone else should have written the script because Zombie doesn't have a clue as to how to build suspense or how to flesh out characters. Note to Rob Zombie: flesh out your characters! And that doesn't mean rip-the-flesh off your characters either.STORY: $$ (***Like I mentioned***, the story is very weak. There isn't any new ground charted. Rob Zombie had a great premise to work with and his heart was in the right place, but he just isn't talented enough as a writer to pull off his vision. He should have went with Carpenter's original idea, keeping Michael the son of well-off parents instead of making the boy a bullied stripper's son. A path to psychotic behavior is painted easier, and far more boring mind you, by thrusting a character into depravity than by having the character enter depravity on his own accord).VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (Nonstop. Modern horror films are simply gorefest sleaze, abandoning story for the thrill of blood and guts. Man, I miss the good old days of DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT and DEAD AND BURIED!)ACTING: $$$ (The acting really wasn't a problem, although Rob Zombie has an obvious allegiance to low-grade ham actors like Sid Haig. Surprisingly, Mrs. Rob Zombie, Sheri Moon, gives one of the best performances here as Michael's well-meaning but misguided mother. She doesn't play the helium voiced psycho like she did in 1,000 CORPSES but actually portrays a convincing human being. Although, Rob makes it a point to give a close-up to her ass - he's just obsessed, what can you say. Scout Taylor-Compton is a young actress to keep an eye on. With the right talent agent, she should leave sleaze like this behind her and embark on a decent film career. Brad Dourif was the greatest miscast in this film - he is not sheriff material. That kid who played Michael Myers was also lacking in the talent department and Klebe was atrocious. The talented Dee Wallace was wasted and I didn't like Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Loomis either).NUDITY: $$$$ (About as much as the gore. Both Danielle Harris (HALLOWEEN IV) and Hanna Hall (FORREST GUMP) prove that they're not child actors anymore, removing their tops. The non actor Klebe also has a full nude scene).",True

76811,22 December 2008,Aaron1375,The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008),3.0,"Let me start off by simply stating that if you have seen the trailers for this movie you have basically seen all the special effects shots this film has to offer. There is really no surprises to be found within the movie other than a rather strange twist involving the robot. The only thing you get to see that is not really shown in the trailers is the fact there is an annoying kid throughout this movie that really takes this film down a notch. As for the plot, it reminds me of an alien fugitive movie more than an alien invasion movie. The centerpiece of the movie, the robot Gort, is just about a no show which is a pity seeing as how his first appearance is the highlight of this film. It looks good and intimidating, and it only has a couple of scenes to show what it can do. Most of the movie is an alien visitor wishing to speak with the world leaders, but all us Americans want to do is fight a force that is clearly capable of wiping us out rather easily. Alien befriends mother and awful stepson to some extent and ponders whether to destroy us all or not. Granted there is more to it than that, but for the most part it is a talky, preachy and rather dull science fiction movie. Keanu Reeves makes the movie somewhat tolerable, however, most of the cast is not that good and the less said about the stepson's performance the better...hell, if that is what all Earth children are ***like then go ahead destroy us all! A couple of special effects scenes are also impressive, but like I said*** nothing you have not seen if you have seen the trailers.

But, after just watching the beginning with all the killings Gurdy the Clown (Jack Amos) did I knew it was going to be a great film. Which it was! Jack Amos portrayed the character of Gurdy the Clown very well. Raine Brown plays Christine Greaston. Raine did a great job in playing her character who at times gets a little crazy. Both of them are a lot of fun to watch and follow as they create tons of carnage throughout the movie! I think the beautiful Georgia Chris was cast well for her role too.I would not say this film is slow paced ***like some have mentioned***. In fact, I would say it is perfectly paced and with a lot of action. They really pack a lot of killings through out the film. That's where FX expert and director Marcus Koch comes into play. Marcus is an FX specialist and does a great job with the killings, they look very realistic. I think this is what helps separate this film from other Independent horror films.

76916,23 December 2008,agvg75,Taken (I) (2008),10.0,"This movie never stops. It is a relentless film about a father determined not to loose his daughter. In the opening this is in the form of quitting his job and life to be closed to her and her new family, however it is when she becomes the victim of some very bad guys overseas that his determination becomes raw for all to see. Definitely a violent movie along the lines of ""A History Of Violence"" and Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish"" series. Liam Neeson kicks butt and takes numbers through the entire movie and riding on audience empathy for his situation spares no one. Unlike many kidnap movies where the father-turned-rescuer is usually a regular man driven to extraordinary circumstances, here is an extraordinary man driven to an ordinary life that gets pulled back into what he does best, killing bad guys. In this sense the movie really rides the same wave as ""A History of Violence"" and if you like either one of them you are likely to like the other. Unlike ""A History..."" however, this film feels faster and reaches deeper into your guts. ***Like some other person said***, the fastest 93 minutes you'll spend.",True

The premise sounds like that it would make for a decent little fantasy film but oh boy, did they mess up on this one! Why did they screw this up? Let's take a look and find out!Firstly, the story. Now the basic premise about a young hero on a journey to collect seven dragonballs to stop an alien from using them to resurrect some monster a while ago sounds generic but fun regardless of how faithful it is to the original manga(which I haven't read) but the problems here lie with the characters, pacing, and acting.The characters here are just terrible. Goku is just some stereotypical, cliché, misfit teenager who gets picked on by bullies and has a crush on a girl. I know that you need to make your main hero relatable but because he is so cliché and stereotypical, you don't see him as a real person. Plus, Justin Chatwin is a horrible actor but more on that later. Bulma is just irritating. She has this constant high-pitched voice which makes me wonder if she was dubbed or something and she always tries to say something witty but her lines are just cringe- inducing! Master Roshi is just weak. He's supposed to be the wise old mentor like Obi-Wan Kenobi or Mr. Miyagi but we never see him mentor Goku enough so he's just kinda there and his ""funny scenes"" just aren't funny. And Yamcha is just annoying. He sounds ***like a mix between Arnold Schwarzenegger and George Takei and his dialogue is just awful! They are these really cringy one-liners and it doesn't help that they're delivered by him!So the characters in this movie are written really bad but how are the performances? As mentioned*** above, Justin Chatwin is a terrible actor! His line deliveries are so awkward and stilted, a stickman can emote better than him! Emmy Rossum does okay as Bulma but her voice is just irritating. Still, she's one of the better actors in this movie but that isn't saying much. Chow Yun-Fat, who is one of my favorite actors, seems to be phoning it in this movie. You can tell while watching this because he doesn't even seem like he wants to pronounce the words correctly, he just seems like he wants to get it over with. Still, a phoned in Chow Yun-Fat performance is still more enjoyable to watch rather than Justin Chatwin doing his best. And Joon Park as Yamcha is also a terrible actor! His emotions seem so forced and unreal and he's just annoying with the way he talks. All in all, the acting in this movie is awful!This movie feels rushed. It has a runtime of 75 minutes if you don't include the credits and because of this, this movie feels really rushed. They have this big epic story in here and they go through all the plot points so fast that you'll be so confused watching this for the first time. Apparently, the first draft of the script was a lot longer but because the producers felt that it would cost too much, we get this sh!tty script instead!Lastly, this movie is awfully directed. They open with this shot of Goku's face as this tear is running down is his eyes and going down to his nose in slow-motion and it just looks disgusting! What was the point of that shot? And then later on, we have Goku and Chi Chi falling for each other and Bulma and Yamcha falling for each other and it's so cliché, so rushed, so poorly acted, it's laughable!

""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was the masterpiece who not only launched the legendary saga of adventure and the fantastic history of the unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), but also invented the cinema's entertainment, all thanks to a revolutionized and classic story! Early on we see this man who seems to be a cowboy (cowboy hat, a revolver, a whip, daah). We see him and a small group of Latinos venturing in the jungles of South America, soon the audience knows that he is searching for an ancient treasure entering into a cave. There he is faced with several decaying corpses and discovers that the whole room is full of traps. After getting out the golden statue of his precious place, he burst out run and we received the classic chase scene of a huge round stone. After our hero get-away, but he just falls into another deadly trap by a competitor. Our hero escapes again, and later we discoveres that the movie story takes place on the year of 1936, before the second Great War, and our hero is called Indiana Jones and he is a professor and archaeologist who works for a museum. Then, Jones learns about a biblical artifact called ""The Ark of the Covenant"" from the healer of the museum and also discovers that this artifact might hold the key to human existence and the powers of god. Now Jones embarks on this adventure to great places ranging from the mountains of Nepal to the deserts of Egypt with the help of his former lover Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). However, he will have to fight against his competitor Renee Belloq (Paul Freeman) and an army of Nazis in order to reach it.The whole story since the very beginning became a classic thanks to Lawrence Kasdan's writing improving by every minute of the film, delivering great dialog explanations of the historical artifacts in the film are very realistic and very simple, leaving the viewer feeling pretty smart. Not only with artifacts explanations that the scripts stands out, but delivers us several humoristic moments with a really smart and fun humor, full of cultural references of the time of the story. But not only humor that makes and revolutionize the movie, but is the change of tone, giving really dark and serious moments to Indi's journey across the globe.Speaking of Indi again, that is another character made by Lucas and starring Harrison Ford that sticks in our minds forever. While in the ""Star Wars"" trilogy we have the funny and unforgettable Lando, here ***like I said*** before we have professor Indiana Jones badass, smart and once again unforgettable. Both of then became legendary, but Indi is the one that we never had seen before, and till today makes you think. At that time, people never had seen a hero that is a human like any other, getting punched; shoot at; throw at a river of snakes, by every passing minute, but always getting out of the situations full of scars and bleeding. And Indi is a character that make's humor and jokes of the situations that he is presented (not like Lando who delivers badass phrases by every minute).The script (considered one of the best ever written for a film) is excellent, but in technical aspects the movie is marvelous. Spielberg's direction nor comments, delivering chase sequences and action scenes that are breathtaking and are extremely fun, and also feeling really realistic. Everything bathed with John William's unforgettable soundtrack that gets stuck in your head forever (and ever since only made Star Wars soundtracks and every single Spielberg movie).A unforgettable classic that began one of the best trilogies ever made and it will live forever, thanks to a marvelous direction of Spielberg; superb writing; unforgettable character with an amazing performance from Ford. The masterpiece that invented cinema's entertainment, but none entertainment movie of today hold a candle close to this beautiful blend of a serious story with James Bond style and ""The Treasure of sierra Madre"" quest all with great quality that show's Lucas and Spielberg minds working together is still today considered a adventure's masterpiece.10/10",True

I didn't realize at the time how much of an ego-fest this movie really is for Seagal. This film is a bad attempt at making an environmental message out of an action flick, laced with Seagal trying his best to out bad-ass himself at every turn. You know a movie is bad when you have your character flown in to a burning oil rig just to press a button. Anyway Seagal does some work for this oil company which it turns out has been using faulty equipment on its rigs including the newest rig which is about to go fully operational. Seagal finds out whats going on but the bad guys try to kill him, they fail, he escapes, gets in touch with his inner spirit, loads up on enough weapons to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger (yeah I know), kills a few dozen people, blows up the rig, then ends the film with a nice message about working together to save the environment. Okay, whatever.***Like I said*** Seagal uses every chance he can to show us how much of a bad-ass he can be which is just laughable when it happens. Michael Caine stars as the stereotypical greedy CEO of the oil company who comes off so evil he might as well be a Bond villain at this point. There are a few OK action scenes and a couple of funny one-liners but otherwise a forgettable movie and the only one that Seagal would direct.

I loved Captain America, Thor, Iron Man 1 & 2 (haven't seen 3, yet), and especially Avengers. X-Men First Class was pretty good, but not great. The Amazing Spider-Man was certainly lacking in pretty much everything, save for CGI/special effects.Yes, the CGI/special effects were awesome... I would argue that they improved these effects from Spider-Man (2002). However... that did little to save it from being a horribly disappointing movie.When I watched this, I was expecting something of excellence, ***like the previous movies I mentioned***. Something true to the origin, something that would get fan approval, and something with character development and an exceptional story. This is, after all, Marvel's bread-and-butter - besides X-Men/Wolverine, of course.So... I waited with baited breath and continued to wait... and continued to be disappointed. Lo' and behold - there was no character development. The characters weren't even believable... Peter Parker the nerdy, accomplished skateboarder? Really? Peter Parker the woman's man? Sneaking up to his girlfriend's bedroom via the fire-escape? Really? Peter Parker? I'm sorry, but no.The plot/storyline was shallow and paled in comparison to Spider-Man (2002). I watched Spider-Man (2002) just the other night, and again, I was blown away... just as I was when it first arrived on the Silver Screen. I was so blown away back then that I saw it five different times in the theater. Even the music was paltry. In 2002, you were enticed with a Danny Elfman theme that just blew you away and prepared you for ensuing awesomeness. What did you have for this one? James Horner not even trying.I'm greatly disappointed by this mess. Tobey McGuire? Believable. Andrew Garfield? Not so much. The same could be said for each actor via a side- by-side comparison for both movies. A sadly and horribly disappointing new direction for Spider-Man. To think that there will be sequels to this... *gag*",True
78391,10 September 2013,chribren,First Transmission (1982 Video),8.0,"""First Transmission"" is a British shockumentary from 1982, made by Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth.As a warning, this film is NOT to be viewed to any viewer under 18. Also this film is not recommended to any squeamish viewer because of the explicit content mentioned below.Some basics about the content, NO ending spoilers included: This almost 4-hour-long shockumentary film consists of several slow-pacing segments, which all together include sick and twisted stuff like: a Satanic ritual, castrations, footages of a Mexican boy getting some device in his left arm, clips from ""Guyana: Crime of the century"", the full short film ""SXXX-80"" and a ""Psychoporn"" sequence set to some weird music.As far as I know, this film has not been released on DVD at once, it was only released on VHS, in four parts when the film was made in the UK. And therefore this film is to be looked at as a pretty rare shockumentary film made in UK. Honestly, it is not common for this country to make such direct-to-video movies like this. Even the United States could have made this as films ***like ""Faces of Death"" and ""Traces of Death"" were made in said*** country.Also it is not common for a shockumentary films to last for as long as 4 hours; most other films in this genre usually last for between 60 to 90-minutes.Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth, who made this film, was a fellowship founded by several groups in 1981, including music bands like Psychic TV, Coil and Current 93.I have said this before, but again, this film is NOT to be viewed, neither to any squeamish people or any viewer under the age of 18. Hope you can endure this long-running shockumentary flick as I just did for just a hour ago, well if you are into this kind of disturbing stuff like this... ;-)",True

I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But ***like so many other people who wrote*** comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",True

78527,11 September 2013,bob-rutzel-1,Star Trek Into Darkness (2013),8.0,"Khan ( Benedict Cumberbatch) makes his appearance known by destroying a library archive and also Starfleet headquarters. It is up to Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and his crew to hot-wire the Enterprise and run down Khan to finish him off.Okay, folks here we go again. Remember this is a reboot, it's not your father's Star Trek. Yeah, I know: tough getting used to.This was very good despite some criticisms. Actually, too much CGI, and Special Effects, - and they were terrific - but that's the trend these days. We still don't like the relationship between Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) as it's just too forced and no chemistry comes out of it. Spock's explanations are cookie-cutter spiels that we have heard way too often. Nothing new. And, when there is an emergency at hand he'll go on for 2-minutes of why or why not and quote regulations. Yes, the old Spock (Nimoy) did the same thing, but did it quicker. See? This is the perfect example of why we like Capt Kirk who runs on gut feelings and not many words. Old Mr. Sulu (George Takei) always said, ""Aye, Captain"" but the new Mr Sulu (John Cho) says, ""Yes, sir."" We like ""Aye, Captain"" better. What else did you not like? I did not like that the head of Starfleet Command, Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller), goes rogue. We like having confidence in the men at the top. This was uncalled for. Dr. McCoy um "" Bones"" (Karl Urban) played his part exactly like the old Bones (Deforest Kelley) would have. In other words, he complained about everything, but he needed to be more animated. Next time, okay? One day we'd like to see Bruce Greenwood get more screen time. He played Christopher Pike, the first Captain of the Enterprise.Breaths of fresh air: Scotty (Simon Pegg) who said the same thing the old Scotty (Doohan) would say, but the New Scotty has better facial expressions. The other breath of fresh air was Benedict Clumberbatch. We enjoyed his presence, commanding voice and superior delivery. Great job. If any of you saw the movie: ENEMY MINE, then you will enjoy Captain Kirk partnering up with Khan for a brief mission. Say, what?Still very good, even though we get a lot of redundancy. Hey, let's move on and assume the audience knows the characters in and out. Okay? Stop repeating the same things over and over again.Old Spock (Leonard Nimoy) makes an appearance giving guidance to New Spock. This needs to stop or just bring the old crew back and we'd all be the happier for that. Bringing the Old Spock back was not necessary. Nice to see him, but still: not necessary. Chris Pine is a very good Captain Kirk. And, this is hard to believe, but at times he almost looked like William Shatner. ***Like I said***: hard to believe. And, guess what are back? Tribbles. Yes, you read that correctly, and they play an important part later on. Hard to believe, I know. All in all, this was very good. The plot is a good one when you hear Khan spell it all out for Captain Kirk.I know I have to get over comparing new Apples to old Apples. Hey, I 'm working on it. It's just not easy. These reboots bring out the ""yeah, but "" in me. I'm working on it. .. (8/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only the S-word was heard at times. Not often.",True

Based along the lines of ""Kentucky Fired Movie,"" ""Dirty Movie"" is nothing but a string of obscene and demented characters acting out the dirty jokes your acid-baked dumb-ass former friends used to tell in school. Basically ""The Benny Hill Show"" on acid, except without the humor, clever one-liners or the witty repartee, the movie is a string of obscene material and tasteless dialogue interspersed with scenes of an extremely low-budget film company trying to make a movie with nothing but jokes which get worse and even more controversial as it continues. It doesn't push the envelope; it ignores it completely. The movie fails to realize the difference between dirty jokes and offensive jokes; dirty jokes are basically humor directed at misunderstandings of human vices and stigmas, such as drinking and sex. Offensive jokes are purposely based on ignorance and intolerance and directly aimed at religious, cultural and ethnic groups. The vignettes of the filmmaking crew are the only partially interesting thing about the film; especially as the creators debate between art and sensationalism. Christopher Meloni of ""Law & Order"" plays a typical despicable director, a man completely without morals, humanity or any redeeming human qualities, joined by Robert Klein as the equally emotionally-deficient producer and Cyndi Lauper as a mom in a few sketches. The only thing interesting about the fake sketches is that as they go on, it starts becoming noticeable that even they seem to share a loose storyline of characters with a male bartender playing straight man, a cute female bartender delivering lines to drunks, a psychotic young boy (Cyndi's boy), a demented and unprofessional physician, some stoned redneck farmers and a mad priest among others. The nudity is confined to more than a few bare breast shots; a few of the women are actually attractive (one particularly homely one turns out in the commentary to be a pseudo-famous female impersonator), but the movie is so focused on indecency and immorality that they're reduced to set dressing than plot points. ***Like I said***, the only interesting parts of the movie are the internal debates on what constitutes obscene material and just what it is willing to do or not do, but most of the time, the movie just drags its feet across the line for no purpose at all but to be shocking. Ignore trying to be funny, the film wants to appall and disgust. (Worse yet, there are adolescent kids in some of the scenes.) Bottom line: the only people who might appreciate this film are stoners, drunks and immature college students.",True

There are...um...some guys, I guess, and um...some girls and, well, one of them is Kelly Clarksson, and they uh, go to the beach and there is singing, and also dancing, and I umm, I guess they fall in love, perhaps?Taking a look at the plot summary, we learn that Justin and his two friends go to Spring Break in Miami where they run into Kelly and her two friends. Despite a complete lack of chemistry (and acting ability) Kelly and Justin apparently fall in love, even though Justin is a party guy, and Kelly is a shy guy. Kelly's friend tries steel Justin away, drama ensues, Kelly confronts friend, drama ends, Kelly and Justin live happily forever after.Now, I understand that a musical movie ***like this will have a simplistic plot, the focus being on the relationship between the characters and the music but like I said***, the relationship between the characters is pretty lackluster and you will be hard pressed to find someone singing along to the music.

Oh, except for one little hitch. I forgot to mention that the town has since been taken over and overrun by killer robots. As if Edgar Wright was going to let us off that easy. Naturally chaos ensues and eventually the band of drinking chums find themselves in a struggle for survival and a literal fight to the finish. This film is bar-none, the most fun you will have at the theater all summer, if not your entire life. It is chalk full of sci-fi, comedy, horror, action, and of course, drinking. This is the third installment of the ""so wrong it's Wright"" trilogy and surprisingly one of the most successful.

Now I'm not saying that in a bad way, I'm just being honest. Does that mean it's a bad movie? No...but it depends on if you are a fan of this type of film.It's a faux documentary / found footage style film that tells the story of 2 friends, Michael & Antwan. 2 war veteran serial killers who thrive on kidnapping, torturing, raping, & murdering women. Throughout the movie, you slowly learn about how these 2 became the sickening duo they are. Having to work with pretty much ZERO budget, the movie was well shot & edited. The acting ( esp Sceiro & Glazier ) was really convincing & nauseating. I know some people have compared it to certain other films of this genre but I won't. I can see the inspiration but A.H. has it's own feel to it.Do I recommend seeing it? Yes...but ***like I said*** before, only if you ""like"" these type of flicks.",True
78987,11 September 2013,talarisw,Dragon Ball Z (1996–2003),9.0,"I'm no expert on anime aka Japanese animation but I like the genre. Dragonball Z is by far my favorite anime. Toriyama's dragonball saga are the king of anime. It's no doubt the most iconic anime ever or at least in America. I think Akira is a very talented writer and is master at developing stories and creating characters but I do think that he sometime disregard characters and plot points to suit his story. Also a lot of people say how the fight sequences are way too long, which is true but they're also well crafted. This is different from it's predecessor dragonball but makes for a good sequel. I like how in the dragonball series we get to see Goku, his friends and family grow up unlike most cartoon characters like Charlie Brown and the Simpsons who never age. In dragonball we see Goku as a kid, in Dragonball Z(dbz) we see Goku as an adult and dad and in Dragonball GT we see Goku as an old man and granddad. I like how dbz is split up in sagas then seasons and I think that's the best way to review it. The series begins with the ""Saiyan Saga"" that takes place 7 years after dragonball. The star of the series is Goku a kind-hearted martial art expert who lives in the woods with his wife Chi-Chi and his son Gohan(named after his step dad ""grand pa"" Gohan) and he meets his old friends from dragonball like Bulma, she is one of my favorite characters and possibly the 2nd most important character in the series. Krillin, Goku's best friend and comic relief. And Master Roshi, Goku's and Krillin's former martial art teacher and pervert. Then we meet earth's biggest threat up until this point, the Saiyans an race of ruthless, bloodthirsty alien warriors who act as mercenaries, invading planets and destroying it for other aliens. Thus, we meet one of my favorite villains from dbz, Raditz. Who comes to earth looking for his younger brother, Kakorot who is Goku! So we find out that Goku's an alien. Later we meet the super strong Nappa and Vegeta, the prince of all saiyans who will become the breakout star of the show. But the good thing is their home planet was destroyed 20 years ago so only 4 are left but earth is still in great danger from the 3. This is the best saga in the series, I love the plot twist that Goku's a saiyan, it fits perfectly. I like how someone as good natured as Goku could come from a race of brutal killers. The saiyans make for great villains. I love Raditz, he's ruthless and his sonic the hedgehog like hair style is awesome. It's a shame he pretty much disappears after this saga, I wish he would of came back or at least be mentioned in future sagas. I also love Vegeta who is a really menacing villain and who's more evil then the others. But I don't like how Akira disregards Piccolo's(a villain from dragonball) back-story. He was Piccolo Jr. the son of the evil Piccolo, who's spirit lives within him but all of that is forgotten as Akira turns him into one of the good guys. Next is the ""Namek saga"" where Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan go into outer space to planet Namek, there they meet Vegeta and worst yet his boss, Frieza an evil planet conquer who has the reputation of being the most powerful being in the universe. Frieza is my favorite villain in the series, he's like a cross between Satan & Adolph Hitler. He's the most important villain in the story and I like his right hand man, Zarbon. In the ""Ginyu Force saga"" we meet Frieza's special forces who are a great group of comical but deadly warriors. In the ""Frieza saga"" Goku comes to Namek and faces off against Frieza and we get to see Frieza's true power and Goku turns into a ""super saiyan"" and defeats him. This one goes on forever, it's way too long but still great to watch. In the ""Trunks saga"" we see Frieza is brought back to life by his father, the evil King Cold. They come to earth but are killed by Trunks, Vegeta's son from the future. This one starts off good but I don't ***like how quickly they killed off Frieza but I like the introduction of Frieza's father but they don't explain much about him like why is he called king? and they said*** he was stronger then his son but they never showed it. I like Trunks but I don't like how Vegeta went from being pure evil to a good guy with a bad attitude, didn't make sense to me. In the ""android saga"" we meet half human half robots killers. I like Android 17 & 18 who in another time line wrecked havoc. I like them because they're teenagers out to have fun not conquer but they're idea of fun is mayhem. In the ""cell saga"" we meet a special android who's made up of the cells of great fighters. I like him because he's cool, sophisticated and calm. But by this time we get too many ""super saiyans"" with Goku, Vegeta, Gohan and Trunks all becoming ""super sayains"". In the final saga, ""Boo saga"" we meet an indestructible villain, Boo. The saga goes on for too long but I like the 3 Boos, baby boo, evil boo and kid boo. Unfortunately some of the characters from dragonball like Yamcha, Tien, Chazu, Parr, olong and Launch get overshadowed by the super saiyans and the villains. I love the comical moments. The fight scenes are the best ever any where! Goku is one of the greatest heroes ever! DBZ and it's predecessor dragonball are my favorite anime of all-time.",True

This movie is a real head trip. It is an original story-not based on any previous material-that is written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who directed Inception, the Dark Knight movies and Memento, just to name a few. John plays a C.I.A. agent that gets recruited by a mysterious new organization called Tenet. Robert is his new partner in this new spy club. Kenneth plays the villain that has some kind of precognitive powers that he uses to make himself a very successful bad guy. Elizabeth plays his abused wife and John decides to try to use her to get to Kenneth and stop him from destroying the world as we know it-like any good spy would do. There are scenes that are shown from different perspectives and you learn things about something that you saw in an earlier scene. I know that sounds a little weird but ***like I said*** earlier, this movie is a head trip and needs to be seen more than once in order to catch everything. In the movie, there is a term used a lot called 'Time Inversion' to explain the backwards and forwards jumping around in time concept. Tenet is also a palindrome-the same word backwards and forwards. If you like action/espionage movies with a little time traveling thrown in for good measure, then you should enjoy this one.

80006,19 February 2016,KineticSeoul,The Last Samurai (2003),10.0,"This isn't a very accurate historical movie and not because it has a white guy playing the Last Samurai. But it's a riveting movie, that has depth and a style that sticks. I remember watching this in theaters and being blown away by how immersive and entertaining this film was at that time. I still watch it from time to time and just doesn't seem to get old. I love films, but a film has to be exceptionally good for me to revisit and check out all over again. And ***like I said***, I watched this movie multiple times. It's like a fantasy movie with historical elements coming to life. And when I mean fantasy, I mean the way they portrayed the samurais in this. They really tried to over glorify and glamorize the samurai and their way of life. It made it appear more like a samurai anime over real samurais in japan at the time. Like they only cared about honor over hierarchy and power. The armor, appearance and the way they dressed was off as well. Yoji Yamada's Samurai Trilogy is a more realistic portrayal of samurais. But that is just what it is, it's a samurai fantasy movie and it's very entertaining to sit through. The film is over about 2 hours and 30 minutes long but feels like a 1 and a half film. While the story being inspired by a real historical figure Jules Brunet, it doesn't even touches the surface when it comes to that area. Watching this is sort of like watching a epic ""300"" movie. Except with more immersive and heartfelt story that strays away from it just being about the action and violence with more character development. Tom Cruise is outstanding in this and was at the time the perfect guy to play the lead role as the emotionally damaged character named Nathan Algren. Who is a captain in this story that fought against the Indians and has guilt trips about it all. This was the breakout role for Ken Watanabe who plays the supporting character in this. As katsumoto who is the leader of the samurais, he brings about charisma and standout presence when he is on screen. Some say this is like ""Dances with Wolves"" except with samurais. However I liked this film more. This is a emotional film about code and honor, that pierces through the screen and has an affect like Hayao Miyazaki films. 10/10",True

80068,19 February 2016,claudartqueste,Shark Tank (2009– ),1.0,"I started watching this show not expecting to develop a very low opinion of the series but that is what happened after watching it for a few months with family members in the living room. At best, I think the sharks on the show only have the right to be called complete selfish idiots and their behavior is not only harming many of society's victims in domestic abuse, workplace management, and even ongoing violent white collar crime, they actually are harming their own image as you can document with the synopsis of Robert Herjavec's attempted suicide publication that he himself discussed in interviews. It certainly does not surprise me that people at petty and disgusting as those on this show could think they have nothing left to live for with all their money. They are 100% giving many monsters the needed impetus to beat their wives, sicken their children, and ultimately fire good employees that they like to bash, leaving many horribly unemployed even with families. The reality is in this country shows like this are somehow applauded and not recognized for sick, lame, and pathetic. When you watch this show for a long time, you see that the contests look like they are sick to their stomachs, and not just obviously very uncomfortable. It's like watching a show from another era with a nasty dictator who will look at the kindest and complete people and decide to shame them for not even what could be wrong with anything about them, but just whatever the dictator wants to say that often is not even based in reality. The saddest part of the show is when you feel horrified for the latest insult someone said, ***like when Kevin O'Leary told someone with a dog nutrition bar that it is ""poop on a stick"" or when he told a completely blind man with a visor, ""you are not dead but you are not really alive,"" or even when he said*** to one of the most competent presenters according to Barbara and Mark Cuban on the show, ""What if the bigger companies squash you like the cockroach that you are?"" and then realize that the other sharks actually are not being sincere when they start to apologize for the behavior of the comments of Leary or someone else and then say something even more sick or ridiculous to the presenter to show they actually aren't giving a crap about their behavior either and are totally faking feeling mortified for the sharks who act insanely. There is just no redemption in watching a show about American circus clowns feeding off the work and pride of well meaning entrepreneurs who sadly never have the nerve to put the sharks in their place. The unknown statistics that this show is creating in the American circus of murder, violence, and workplace racism and total insanity will forever be unknown. For now, I hope the sharks lose as many professional credits and lasting friendships for being such utter classless and monstrous participants in siphoning off the faith and good will of American workers and families watching the show. I hope everyone watching the show can learn that no matter how much money you have, you still ultimately only have how much value you put into your own self as these clowns ultimately display as an important lesson when they feel personally threatened enough by intellect or looks of the participants to need to try to humiliate them despite being so wealthy. I also hope watchers of the show begin to research how bogus not only the lack of employee rights are in this country compared to almost all of Europe and even major Asian countries like Japan and Singapore, but really we have no rights in our medical field even as an off shoot of catering to sick, psychopaths like this and it is 100% true that everyone in this country who gets terminal diseases such as cancer will never once be told that there was a Nobel Peace Prize given in 1931 for oxygen's ability to stop the growth of cancer so fake ""professionals"" like the show's sharks can continuing ""professionally"" ruining all American life and further dreams. That's what the show's mentality is supporting--low level murder and then ultimately the loss of all rights in this corporate system like medical freedom for even the wealthiest of doctors trying to help anyone or their patients. In this country that likes shows like this, doctors will lose their medical license if they even mention ""Otto Warbug and the Nobel Peace Prize for the halt of the growth of cancer cells"" because clowns like this control the entire medical practice and think that like the pons they insult, reality can be reduced to crap as the sharks so often praise discussing.",True

Set is typical goodness for this series of releases, except for one thing. On Episode 80, about 2/3 of the way through the episode the video gets shuffled around and becomes de-sncyed with the audio.

I never liked Russian old emblems, expressions, and ***like Stein said*** about USA ""it's not perfect"" nowdays, but.... how horrible a show must be to make a character say such things about Russia? Again, I'm not a patriot, but he said that it's ruled by crooks and criminals, that we don't have free voting, and we aren't allowed to love whoever we like. First off, if you came o Russia you wouldn't see any criminals, like is modern and peaceful. Of course, like in any country, there are criminals, but in my life I saw only a few. Stein made it look like it's like some kind of criminal country. I don't see the percentage of criminals here being bigger than in any other country. We don't have fair voting system? just wait till we are allowed to vote for another president after our economy crashed. Something tells me far less people will be supporting Putin during the next election. and third Stein said we are not allowed to love whoever we want. If it's about anti-gay thing everyone talks about then again - the law is NOT against being gay, you are allowed to have any orientation here as you want, nobody's gonna arrest you for that. The law is against gay PROPAGANDA which is completely different. We are allowed to have any partners we choose. Just because the propaganda is restricted doesn't mean the homosexual relationship is forbidden. it's like the writers of this show took the worst stereotypes of Russia and put it into Stein's speech.Like it wasn't enough that the creators used google translate to make signs and covers in these 2 episodes, that many of the stereotypes about Russia were collected in one episode, after Stein's speech I don't think that Americans show russians like this because of ignorance, but because they actually want to hurt Russia and russians, presenting them this way to their target audience.I was even gonna say ""this episode made my day"" when Snart said ""this isn't my first prison break"" (that like was awesome) but after Stein's speech I'm convinced this is one of the worst shows ever in terms of writing(and I don't just mean Russian stuff, Swiss cheese has less holes than logic in this show). Oh by the way, almsot forgot - Gulag prisons were closed in 1960. Yet it still exists even in Arrow.Conclusion - Americans! don't be ignorant, don't believe shows like this and Arrow.

80311,19 February 2016,ElMaruecan82,Deadpool (2016),8.0,"Indeed, this review is mostly for non-fans of superhero movies, because the fans probably saw it already and doesn't need this to know how good it is. Flawless logic, isn't it? They say the first twenty minutes are crucial, you can tell from them whether you're going to enjoy the film or not. Well, with ""Deadpool"", the matter is solved at the very first minute with what probably constitutes the most hilariously creative opening credit sequences ever, or let's say 'one of the', to stay on the safe side although I really can't tell another opening that made me laugh like this one, or maybe ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". Anyway, I won't spoil it for all the IMDb badges in the world, but let's say, that it was the total opposite feeling than ""'I expected nothing, yet I felt let down"", This time, I expected something big and I was still blown away.At that moment, I never doubted I was going to enjoy it, I knew I could comfortably sink into my seat and I'll keep up smiling and laughing all through the film, I mean, one that manages to make you laugh in the credits sequences is like gently telling you ""we care about you"", yes, that's what it shows, a sort of special VIP dedication to the viewer, not to leave any detail unexploited for the sake of laughs. And it sort of borrows from the Python humor, it's anarchical, out of place, and spares nothing, not even self-derision, and I like that. And boy, the rest of the movie, with its fourth-wall breaking, its flashbacks, its constant nods to the audience never leaves you down, ""Deadpool"" is funny from beginning to end, credits included, and with a creative quality that is Oscar-worthy as far as screen writing goes.Now, remember, I said this review was for non-superhero movies' fans. Not that it's an issue if you love them but I have to warn you, you won't ***like me if I said*** I never loved superhero movies, apart from ""Superman"" maybe, and if there ever was a trend that annoyed me these last years, it was this overdose of Marvel adaptations. I grew up with Tintin, Lucky Luke, Asterix (French-Belgian school) so I loved my heroes ordinary or anti- rather than super. I know some superheroes are more off-hand and comical than others, but if you're not an expert, how will you tell them apart? There are just too many, and when I saw ""Deadpool""'s trailer, I was like, here we are, another Spider-man clone. Yet the tone wasn't exactly the same, , but was it a spoof? I didn't even know the character existed in the X-Men universe so how can a preexisting character parodies the universe he belongs to? Now, do these things really matter? Probably not, the one thing is that the trailer looked funny, and the movie better because it's a signal when a trailer isn't really efficient, it doesn't throw all the gags inside just to mislead you. Now to the story, there's Wade (Ryan Reynolds) a retired Special Forces operative falling in love with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), an escort girl. So, they live a beautiful romance until he's diagnosed with the big C, and leaves Vanessa. Later, he bumps into an Agent-Smith like recruiter who informs him about a special treatment to cure cancer. Wade is treated by the sadistic Ajax and his female and generously-endowed sidekick Angel Dust. After a series of painful treatments and tortures, Ajax reveals his true intentions, turning Wade into a super-slave for wealthy customers. A final process of mutation leaves Wade totally disfigured but able to escape, and become totally indestructible. He needs Ajax to repair his face and while Ajax can't touch him, he takes on his most vulnerable spot: Vanessa. So, Deadpool, with the help of a colossal version of the Tin-Man (without the ridiculous hat) and a malcontent teen who looks like a mix of Sinead O'Connor and Daria, Deadpool is off to save Vanessa.I can hear the déjà-vu bells ringing, but just because the film swims in familiar waters, doesn't mean you're going to drown in an ocean of clichés. Well, there are clichés, actually, who am I kidding? But it's all in the treatment and the writing, and the film acknowledges that the writers are the real heroes, and for reasons: self-derision is the greatest mark of humor and there's something very refreshing in the way the film ridicules its own material, that's exactly how ""Kick-Ass"" started before going downhill with a violence that took itself seriously. ""Deadpool"" never does and that's what a superhero movie should do. By becoming ridiculous in purpose, from the start, ""Deadpool"" is even brilliant and creates a precedent that will make hard to take other superhero movies in a serious light, but in a way, it's a kind of reboot in tone of the superhero sub-genre.And apart from the writing, I also credit Tim Miller's directing for never letting the action steal the fun's thunder, in fact, the way the action sequences are choreographed serves the comedy, not the opposite, and that's a feat you rarely see achieved in movies. The film has a few slower moments here and there, but just when you get the feeling that it's getting closer to the typical material, you realize it's only 'serious' interludes before the fun picks off again.So far, ""Deadpool"" is this winter's winner, and I suspect this is going to break the billion record, because it's the perfect 'word of mouth' movie, I know I can recommend this film, because I know people who're fans of superhero movies, and these are the ones I'll immediately tell to go watch the film because I don't want them to misjudge the film. It is that good.",True
80368,19 February 2016,DogFilmCritic,Cartel Land (2015),8.0,"I like a good documentary specially if it has more than one points of view in the same argument.

Im not particularly fond of the idea these people have on illegal Mexicans as they look at them as scum, but one has to understand the why and they are trying to change the situation for there family's. The Selfdefence unit created by civilians in Mexico out of necessity to protect themselves from the cartels because the police and the military don't help much and more than half are corrupted, leaving them no other choice. Again i do not agree with this method but when your government gives you their back a few choices are left.

80658,20 February 2016,TheLittleSongbird,"Great Performances at the Met: Wagner: Tannhäuser (2015) Season 10, Episode 3",8.0,"Admittedly not everybody is a fan of Wagner. His operas are long, needs a lot of patience and stamina and very demanding on the voice and also instrumentalists and people do find it difficult to separate the composer and his art from how he was as a person. Admittedly he was a horrible man (few take kindly to anti- seminites), but he was a great composer who wrote stirring and emotional music. Tannhäuser may not be quite one of my favourites from Wagner (Tristan and Isolde, Der Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Parsifal, Siegfried and Die Walküre), there is nothing wrong with it, just that there is a preference for those five. The music is wonderful this said, including Wagner's finest overture (narrowly edging out Flying Dutchman and Meistersinger), Pilgrim's Chorus and Wolfram's Ode to the Evening Star (perhaps the closest Wagner came to an aria), when done right the conflicts between the characters are interesting and the story is moving.Is Tannhäuser well served on DVD? There are fair few disappointing ones like Munich's, Werner Herzog's, Zürich, Copenhagen's and Baden Baden's, but there are also some great ones like Bayreuth's and Met's (1980s, despite an over-taxed Richard Cassily in the title role) and the 1989 production directed by Wolfgang Wagner. When this Met Tannhäuser comes out on DVD, for me it will be up there as one of the better ones. Imperfect, but very impressive and musically outstanding. Visually, it is very traditional and sumptuous and rustic in its detail with attractive costumes, atmospheric lighting and really quite exquisite (not overdone or too fussy when it isn't necessary but never too barren) sets. Otto Schenk's staging may be criticised for being conservative, but it isn't dull and has a lot of charm. With the exception of the rather too silly opening ballet at Venusburg, there was much to ***like about the staging particularly in the Hall of Song, the genuinely moving ending and pretty much any scene with Peter Mattei's Wolfram, like the rousing scene between him and Tannhäuser in Act 3 or the understated*** dignity of Ode to the Evening Star. In fact, of all the acts Act 3 was by far the most successful and really came alive.Musically, as has been said before, the production is really outstanding. Throughout the orchestra playing is exceptional, the strings shimmer, the woodwinds play warmly and the brass rouse and ooze nobility without being overpowering, whether off-stage with the horn in the Warburg valley scene or the on-stage trumpets. The chorus sing beautifully, especially in the Pilgrim's chorus, and act with involvement. James Levine's conducting only just occasionally flags a tiny bit, but almost all the time it is sympathetic and authoritative whether in the thicker textures or the intricate ones, there are some lovely colours and carefully chosen speeds here. The sound is very good, as is the video directing, picture quality and HD, and the simulcast is hosted nicely and invitingly.There is much to admire about the singing. Johan Botha is an awkward actor and he is occasionally challenged at first by the daunting tessitura in Act 1 in one of Wagner's most punishing title roles. He does however show good chemistry with his fellow singers, and his singing for most of the production is simply terrific, ringing rather than strained as well as very agile, suitably hefty and musical in the more lyric passages. Whatever nuance, frustration, sadness or torment there was not shown in Botha's acting almost certainly showed in his singing. Eva Maria Westbroek is a touching Elisabeth, whether naïve in the first part of the opera to a stronger and saintlier person. She sings with a beautiful bright tone, if a little unsteady at the top at times, and she clearly understands the role, exciting in her opening Act 2 aria and completive in her prayer, and her duet with Botha sounds great with them together and the chemistry is heartfelt.As Venus, Michelle De Young is alluring and seductive and she has a very rich voice that doesn't sound in any way taxed. Ying Fang is an exquisitely sung Shepherd, not at all daunted by how exposed her music is, while Günther Groissböck is an ever so slightly lightweight but sonorous and dramatically authoritative Hermann Landgraf with impeccable German diction. However, the standout was Peter Mattei's noble and dignified Wolfram, who sings with such warmth, remarkably smooth phrasing (seeing as the breath control is very sustained and hard) and understated and poignant elegance. As good as he is in the valley and contest scenes, he is one of the primary reasons why Act 3 comes off as well as it does. Overall, while not as good as the powerful Il Trovatore that kicked off the 10th season it is an improvement over the interesting but somewhat disappointing Otello. Falls short of being perfect, but it really impresses, particularly musically. 8/10 Bethany Cox",True

Such a pretty film with a good cast, you are just watching to find out if the production costs are worth the story. It is. To think of it like that, in retrospect, is at the very least showing how little it takes to please us. The moving watching public. Could this film have been made in the US? It is so true to the story and unforgiving in every way. In the states, the movies we see are a result of test screenings, dumbed down plots and studios that are looking for maximum profits (""all hail the American corporation machine""). This film is not an easy movie to watch. First of all the whole thing is in subtitles and some of it not even, and doesn't pull any punches. It's was ***like they said*** ""not everyone will get it, not everyone will give it a chance, and most people won't even be exposed to it, but we will say, what we want to say. As an American it was the most connected I've been to an Arabic movie. It is a new generation of film for the world. There are no ""terrorists"" with ""WMD's"" just honest characters and epic performances. We always heard that there were atrocities in this region, but any portrayal I've seen, seems to stop at the stereo typical Arab that is on CNN/Fox. This movie goes beyond that, it's set production is great, costumes, angles of photography are brilliant. So many little extras that make up a great movie. On top of a story that any person, any where could understand. It is appalling and beautiful all at the same time. I hope this hasn't created feeling like you are about to watch, (insert any comic book movie here,) this is real. And emotional. And a tough movie to comprehend. It is just amazing....",True

81516,15 September 2011,Meven_Stoffat,Contagion (2011),8.0,"My review's title comes from Iron Maiden's 1996 song, ""Virus"", in which Blaze Bayley sings of a life threatening virus. That line is followed by ""The murderers, the backstabbers, the two-faced elite, a menace to society, a social disease..."". The ""virus"" in the song evidently takes in a double meaning. And what's really odd is that once I left the cinema at the end, I realized how well the song fits the movie. In Contagion, the main force of the film is people's perception of fear, just like the song.Over the film's opening black screen, we hear a cough. The film's first shot then appears, and we see a very miserable looking Gwenyth Paltrow. Boy, she has clearly had better days. Sadly, this is the best she looks in the entire film. Even adding to the sadness, the film's subsequent subtitle reads ""Day 2"". It does indeed get worse; a number of people all the world have this virus. One even gets hit by a bus, he's so controlled by the virus.The person most affected is Mitch Emhoff. His wife has returned from a trip, and has contracted the virus while in China. She dies right as soon as she is taken to the hospital, and the son soon follows. Meanwhile, a blogger attempts to come up with a scheme to get more information from the CDC about the virus, The CDC keeps track of the virus, tracking where it goes, a Swiss worker in China is held to stay in a village where the population of living and healthy people is minuscule due to the sickness... Ad the tension explodes, thus only building to an unforgettable conclusion.Soderbergh has managed to do here what most movies nowadays don't. He dares to go outside the typical comfort zone of viewers and give us a story that begins right in the middle of it all. Normally this would annoy me, as I like to have things developed before the story begins to take off. But here it's masterfully done, to the point where more shocking secrets shout the virus get revealed. And the film's coda is... Well, let's just say, jaw-dropping.Another thing that makes this a special one is it's lack of a climax. You may argue as to whether or not this film had a climax, but, to me, the film was anti-climatic for a reason. Because really, in the event of a real epidemic or pandemic, the vaccine never is really the end... One place a vaccine emerges, another the virus manages to take over. ***Like I said***, the major force in the movie is fear. It's everywhere in the film. One person fears for his village because of the fact that there's very few healthy left. Another person fears because he only has his daughter and her boyfriend. Two people fear to then point where they go on a rampage, searching for a possible cure. The fear itself is like a virus, leading to the decay of mankind. To use another line from the Iron Maiden song, ""Watching beginnings of social decay, looting and sneering at life's disarray...""In addition, the acting is fantastic. Matt Damon gives a stellar performance as Mitch. This may be his first believable performance since The Departed... He puts so much emotion in the role, and inn general just really gives it his all. Jude Law, Marion Cotillard and Kte Winslet are all fantastic in the movie as well. The film's cinematography is nothing short of stellar too. Shot in the Red Epic camera in 1:78.1, the film is essential IMAX viewing too, as not only did it take up most of the screen, the look of the movie also is something quite different as well.In short, Contagion is a masterfully done thriller, a total recommend, and will leave you thinking long after the credits have rolled. If you want a good movie among a recent s--t storm of bad movies, do check this movie out!""Watching beginnings of social decay...""OVERALL: 10/10PROS: Beautifully shot,, well written and amazingly acted and directed, Contagion is the provoker of the year for sure. you will be discussing this film with who you saw it with for hours after you have walked out after the cinema.CONS: None to speak of, though those expecting a conventional narrative or action packed film may want to see another film instead.",True
81801,16 September 2011,mattias_89,Ringer (2011–2012),9.0,"I watched the first episode of Ringer the other day without knowing at all what it was going to be about. I hadn't planned to watch this particular show this fall but after seeing a lot of promotion for it on various sites, I decided I would give it a chance, but after seeing it I have yet to decide if I will become a regular viewer or not.What did I think of the pilot then? The episode felt very rushed in the beginning. I though the setup of the characters and the main story arc could have needed some more time and work. I didn't really buy why she would run away and hit that policeman and steal his gun and how she really managed to do that. Well, I do understand why she did it but it just felt rushed. Then we got introduced to a sister and without even having the chance to get to know her, she killed herself and it didn't feel weird at all for the lead character to take her sister's place. I thought this was pretty strange and would have liked more time to explain why and what she felt after this. I would rather have the episode end here and put more time into the details of this part of the story, that would have been more interesting.Instead we got introduced to a lot of small intrigues after this. The stepdaughter with cocaine problems, the police hunting the lead character, a gangster hunting the lead character, a failing marriage, the sister cheating with her best friend's husband and some guy trying to kill the sister. You would think I described the whole series now rather than only the pilot but this is what happened. ***Like I said*** before, instead of putting effort into these parts I would have been more interested in exploring the beginning of the show. If this was meant to keep you hooked and meant to bring you back for next week's episode, it worked, but not because I'm particularly intrigued by these things but rather because I'm confused and want to see what this turns out to be.I'll give it another episode but I don't think I will give it more than that nor do I think the network will, it feels like a pretty lazy written show with a plot premise we kind of have already seen this summer in The Laying Game but we will see.",True
81843,16 September 2011,iheart_ny,Contagion (2011),10.0,"Not a lot scares me, when it comes to movies, anyway. I can watch the goriest horror movie, and not be scared, even in the slightest. But ""Contagion"" got under my skin. It has more effect than even the most well-done horror movie, yet, it's not really a horror movie at all. It's mostly a psychological disaster film, and at one point, it feels like something of a docudrama, and then it morphs into a humane psychology story, and has overtones of the power of paranoia and fear that start when the film begins, and don't end until the last, satisfying moments.""Contagion"" is director Steven Soderbergh's first feature this year. A few years ago, he directed two films in the same year, Matt Damon comedy-thriller studio-produced vehicle ""The Informant!"" and porn star Sasha Grey's first mainstream (albeit indie) film, ""The Girlfriend Experience"". This year, he repeats himself, doing two films in the same year, this, and the upcoming independent action thriller ""Haywire"". I'm intrigued to see that one as well, but I can't see it being any better than ""Contagion"".""Contagion"" scared the living crap out of me. It follows characters, living throughout the world, all effected by a mysterious pandemic that threatens the lives of everyone. It's something like bird flu, but not quite. It has the worldwide reaction that H1N1 had on the world, but worse. It becomes a government conspiracy tale, that proves that something of this catastrophic weight is not a cut-and-dry kind of thing. There are twists coming from each imaginable angle. The biggest mystery is how this thing began, which isn't ignored, like I thought it would be.One thing that ""Contagion"" has going for it, is a lot of big names. Kate Winslet, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. Everybody brings more to the table than you expect them to. Each character's story becomes vital to how the story unfolds, and, even as it begins to delude into something of a cut-and-dry docudrama, it pulls the wool out from under your eyes, and surprises you with realistic, yet not melodramatic emotion, and becomes quite the emotionally draining and devastating tale, leaving such an impression on the audience, making this one impossible to tune out.I choose, for this review, not to really get into each character's story, because, one, it would take up too much time, and two, it's much better experienced, not knowing very much about it, as the story unfolds.It'll stick with you for longer than you expect it to. I read advance reviews before seeing it today, that claim that leaving the theatre, no one in the audience spoke about it, or touched anyone, or contacted with anyone around them. Paranoia is a main ingredient to ""Contagion"", proving that no one is immune to fear that is unspoken, but completely pinpointed, and ***like I said***, impossible to ignore. Seeing an afternoon show, in the college town where I live with a few friends of mine, I didn't quite experience this. However, it's completely believable. It leaves you in such a state of paranoia and euphoria, that it's maddening, considering that there aren't many films like this nowadays.Another thing that ""Contagion"" has going for it is how it's made. Soderbergh doesn't waste any time here. Keeping it concise, at a humane running time (105 minutes), it's a roller-coaster from the very first unsettling scene, right up until the last frame. It's written in a way that feels overall very clinical and to-the-point, yet becomes an emotional journey that makes you feel something for each one of its characters. The scariest thing about ""Contagion"" is its plausibility. Unlike your regular horror movie, it has a base which actually could happen, and has happened, in the past. The scares come from things that human beings encounter every day. No ghosts or zombies (in the literal sense of the world) pop out and scare you, while the typical ominous, trying-to-be scary score plays in the background. It's proof that the quietest movies can be the most terrifying. There's a horrifying atmosphere about this one, that sneaks up on you when you least expect it to. This is compelling stuff, don't miss it.Grade: A-",True
82055,7 May 2020,Lily_hoho,Cast Away (2000),9.0,"I think one of the good things about this movie is that it sets up a suspense story, in which the man who opens the door to receive the email betrits his wife, who is the last person destined to be with Chuck.

83718,29 February 2020,rooprect,Superbad (2007),8.0,"Yes, it's funny. It's silly, it's crass, it's irreverant, and it has all the makings of a mindless adolescent farce like the ones I grew up with from American Pie to Revenge of the Nerds and all their sequels. But when this movie ended and the credits rolled I was left speechless in awe. And not just because of all the penis drawings during the credits.""Superbad"" is, as you may expect from any film produced by Judd Apatow (40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, etc), on the raunchy side. So don't be surprised if you see a penis drawing or 2. But what makes this an amazing film is that despite all the raunchiness and partying and horseplay it actually delivers some powerful human and sentimental themes.In the hands of an inferior cast, it would have flopped and come across as cheesy. But with these actors, each delivering a larger than life performance despite playing high school seniors, it's magnificent. I'll give you just 1 example of what I'm talking about...There's a scene where 2 characters are gearing up for a sexual encounter (their first). But one of them (and arguably both) are not ready for it. Unlike all the teen romps that I grew up with, where the goal is for the guy to bed the girl, this scene makes us put the brakes on and consider: Wait... Why is the goal always for the guy to bed the girl?? And at the same time it's really funny and does not sacrifice the film's momentum. I won't ruin the ending of the scene, but let's just say it's satisfying on every level and punctuated with a great gag to make us laugh.""Superbad"" is truly an evolution of the genre. It's every bit as crass and wacky and full of horseplay as all the others since Porky's, but this is the first time one of these mindless comedies dares to make us think and feel on a deeper level. ***Like I said***, it's largely due to the great casting. Michael Cena, if you're not familiar, plays his signature role of an awkward deer-in-the-headlights kid but with a strong sense of who he is, even though nobody else seems to understand. Jonah Hill plays his best friend, sort of the antithesis: a loser who thinks he knows what he wants but he's really quite confused. Emma Stone knocks it out of the park with a great role that's quirky, cool, rebellious and responsible all at the same time. Rounding out the troupe are Bill Hader and Seth Rogan who play a pair of despicable yet loveable cops whose combined IQ is around the same as their blood alcohol level.This flick has it all. It's definitely for mature audiences in terms of language (at least the unrated cut I watched), but ironically it has some great messages for teens and younger viewers, if you can see through the tomfoolery. There aren't many films I can compare this to, but if you've seen ""Easy A"" with Emma Stone (somewhat tamer than this), I'd say ""Superbad"" has the same vibe. A seemingly silly teen comedy that packs a serious punch under the surface.",True

GOD??? THE DEVIL???) curses her to roam the earth killing other innocent children (yup, that certain someone who 'punished' her like this is the movie's true ANTAGONIST)Patricia, another mother of the year, thinks she'd find peace after her 2 innocent children are being murdered by the weeping broad, by getting other 2 innocent children murdered...yup...The shaman dude first decides not to help the desperate mother with 2 children that are being haunted by an evil spirit, even tho that is basically what he does for a living...It felt like the shaman dude was 'chilling' near the Hollywood studio where this was being produced and the crew invited him on set, 0 fu**s given by the actor, he had no idea why was he even there and his attempts at humor were cringy...I am sick of idiot kids risking their lives for a toy, yes I have been a child and I haven't been that stupid at that age...Americans some times forget their houses are so big that they have a back entrance...The mother jumped in the pool to randomly search for her daughter in the water, instead of first pinpointing her exact location from the outside and only then jumping to get her out...The shaman dude hopped in a taxi the next morning, right after the crazy mom Patricia had shot him in the chest or shoulder during the night...hmm, ok...The acting was laughable...Should I go on?

FINALLY, people are starting to put together the pieces that those of us who are either content creators & media influencers, industry insiders, or his small handful of friends have known and been saying about him for a VERY long time! I believe he's only gotten away with things because of his longevity on YouTube, his friendship with people ***like Susan Wojycki (sp), and maybe connections because of all of the this like this show he did! Some of these things are still just allegations, but NOW we're finding out through video proof even that they are in fact, FACT! Some of the things he's done/ being accused of are: making videos talking about masturbating on his cat, CONSTANTLY making videos about other YouTubers pointing out drama and trying to grind them down to make himself look better, making videos that are lewd where he and his girlfriend demonstratively taught his 12yo niece about sex and in doing so with a stuffed ""peeps"" toy to use the ears as legs, he has MANY times singled out a YouTuber while picking sides with another & said*** what he expressed as FACTS only to have to recant in a half-baked apology when it comes out his FACTS are fabrications,and perhaps the MOST HEINOUS came when he called Jake Paul out as a Sociopath in a 3 or 4 part series, where he gave Jake the impression that he was there as a fair,friendly reporter- basically the kind of thing a Sociopath would do! Shane announced to the viewers that Jake Paul(someone I wasn't really familiar with)was a Sociopath several weeks prior to his series,so he had the intention,going in,before he ever really knew the guy(& he admits this) that the whole purpose of the series was to PROVE Jake was a Sociopath! THEN he brings in this girl, & I don't think we ever really got her qualifications,but I don't believe she was an actual Psychologist, I think based on her behavior, actions, & self presentation,that AT BEST she was a counselor! He took her to meet Jake,introducing her as his ASSISTANT, NOT telling him her true job title, NOR telling him of her true purpose- to psychoanalyze him! Which was immoral at best, & possibly illegal in their state if Jake wanted to press charges! They spent the better part of the day,and POOF! She had the diagnosis of Sociopath for him! First off,counselors CANNOT diagnose, only Psychologists or Psychiatrists! Second, ANY professional will tell you, no matter how severe someone's symptoms,you CANNOT make a Psychological evaluation over the course of just a few hours,one day. Too many neuroses present the same way, and you NEED to have a full understanding of what you're dealing with! I have 6 years of Psych between HS & Uni, and SO MUCH of what both she AND Shane were doing infuriated me! Shane NEEDS to be held accountable for any and ALL crimes, & stop getting hall passes because he made all these stupid shows like this! Pffffft Hisssss!",True

Basically on his 21st birthday Tim Lake (Black Mirror: Be Right Back star Domhnall Gleeson, Brendan's son) is told by his father (Bill Nighy) the family secret, all men throughout the family have had the ability to travel back in time, and following the instruction to go into a dark place he tries it out and sees it is true, he cannot change history, only moments in his own personal past. He wants to use his gift to help find true love, and later the following summer his sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) brings her friend Charlotte (Margot Robbie) to stay with the family, near the end of her time with them he decides to tell her his feelings for her, he is heartbroken when even changing what he does with time travel she does not feel the same for him. Tim decides later to go to London to become a lawyer, he moves in with struggling playwright, and acquaintance of his father, Harry (Tom Hollander), and later with his friend he meets Mary (The Time Traveller's Wife star Rachel McAdams) in darkness at a blind dating establishment, it is only outside that they see each other and feel mutual attraction, she gives him her number. Tim hears that Harry's opening night of his new play is a disaster as a lead actor forgot his lines, but travelling back in time he helps the actor and the play is a success, but later trying to call Mary the number is no longer on his phone, because going to the play means that he and her never met. Remembering her interest of Kate Moss he looks for her in an exhibition, and eventually using his time travel method he finds the right approach to say hello, but he is devastated to find she already has a boyfriend, they met the night after the play at a house party, so he travels back so that she and he never meet, and knowing she is bored he invites her for a dinner date with him. Tim and Mary have a good evening, and she is happy to have him walk her all the way home and invite him up to her place, and using his time travelling he is able to enjoy the night with her more than once, and they have many dates after and are very happy. She tells him that she is pregnant, which he is very surprised by, and despite another encounter with Charlotte he knows he loves Mary and proposes marriage to her, and they marry, and later have daughter Posy, and stay happily married through the passing years as he uses time travel to solve the minor problems and have a beneficial life. There is an incident on Posy's first birthday Kit Kat has a car crash following a row with her boyfriend Jimmy Kincade (Tom Hughes) who has caused nothing but trouble since meeting her at the New Year's Party he first time travelled back to, so he tries to stop her ever meeting him and stop the crash happening, but causing this change in history mean Posy will be another child, so he has to allow this crash to happen. Kit Kat eventually recovers in hospital and is back on the mend having split with the boyfriend, Tim and Mary have their second child, son Jeff, but then another tragedy strikes when Tim's Dad is diagnosed with terminal cancer, time travel cannot change this, he had been using his ability to time travel to spend more time with the family as he knew this for some time, he is ready to die. Tim travels back in time often to spend more time with his father while he was alive, then Mary says she wants another child, he knows that this means he will not be able to travel back and see his father any more, so he travels back one last time to see his Dad and tell him, but before going they travel back in time together to spend time on the beach as their younger selves. Tim takes the advice from his father to live every day twice, once normality to have all the stresses of a normal person, the second time knowing what to expect, change the smallest of things and embrace everything, but after having his third child, daughter Jo, Tim comes to realise it is is better to live every day like it was the last and enjoy life with Mary and the family like normal. Also starring Lindsay Duncan as Mum, Joshua McGuire as Rory, Vanessa Kirby as Joanna, Lisa Eichhorn as Jean, Mary's Mother, Tom Hughes as Jimmy Kincade, Richard Cordery as Uncle D and Mitchell Mullen as Fitz, Mary's Father. Gleeson gives a good performance as the young man using the ability to travel back in time to win the girl and connect with his father, McAdams is really beautiful and sweet as the girl the lead male marries and has children with, and Nighy is lovable as the bumbling but always reliable father, supporting cast members get their good moments as well. The story is both clever in the way it makes you laugh, feel affection and cry, and it is clever because it points everything in life we may take for granted, it is a sweet love story, it is a heartwarming father and son story, it is funny in the right places, and it is of course written and performed very well, it is a great romantic comedy science-fiction film.

85967,13 September 2013,falcata_claymore,The Cabin in the Woods (2011),8.0,"Before watching The Cabin in the Woods, you must bear two things in mind:1. This is not a pure horror film. ***Like the Scream franchise before it, this is the kind of movie that tries to function as both a genre film and a parody of the aforementioned*** genre. It is not scary, but it was not meant to be. Plus, if I were to judge a horror film solely on whether or not it genuinely scared me, then I could count the number of successful horror movies I've seen on my fingers.2. This is co-written by Joss Whedon, and whilst it is directed by Drew Goddard, it is very much Whedon's film. If you're not a fan of his particular brand of humor, you'll have a very tough time sitting through The Cabin in the Woods. The majority of the negative reviews of it can be attributed to this, especially those found on this website.With that out of the way, let's talk about how much I adore this movie. It's beautiful. It's fantastic. It's the best horror film I've seen since Shadow of the Vampire. I positively love The Cabin in the Woods; in the last twelve months, I have watched it four times, tying it with Black Dynamite for the movie I've seen the most in a year (which I suppose gives you a pretty good idea of what my sense of humor is like). The premise seems like the same tired movie we've seen in the horror genre too many times since The Evil Dead came out: five college students travel to a decrepit hovel in the middle of nowhere to ""get away from it all"". There, they proceed to drink, get high, and have sex until they find some macguffin (usually an old book, as is the case here) that contains jumbled Latin that raise some form of evil, in this case, a family of undead Rednecks hellbent on murdering all of the students in various brutal ways. But here there's a twist: the whole thing has been rigged by a secret worldwide organization set up to protect the world from being destroyed by the Elder Gods by presenting them with specific blood sacrifices.Herein lies the beauty of the film: the dumb things done by the five young adults have been set up by the organization to make them more suggestible. The requisite promiscuous blonde, for example, is actually a natural brunette who has dyed her hair blonde with a dye that has been chemically treated to make her dumber. On top of that, the inclusion of the giant, shady organization allow for the best scenes in the movie. The employees make the snarky commentary for us, and the funniest bits come from how routine these awful events are to them. They could not be more bored with the fact that five people are being picked off one by one by zombies. None of his is spoiling anything, by the way- the very first scene takes place in this building. You might have been fooled, as I was, into thinking that the trailers gave away the twist. They certainly did not. Nor will I, but I will say that the last thirty minutes get very, very weird. Again, this explains why I'm so fond of this film: there was a time, not too long ago, when horror movies were not only encouraged to be as bizarre as possible, but were expected to be so. It was a lovely time, when even the crap could at least be considered fascinating. Those days are- alas- over, and in its place has sprung up an era of dull, gray, un-creative horror films. For all the gore they heap upon us, most modern horror films have completely forgotten to be interesting. But out of the ashes like a particularly insane phoenix rises The Cabin in the Woods. A film that boldly goes where few horror movies have gone in the last fifteen to twenty years: completely off the rails. And. It. Is. Glorious. The last half our of this film is wonderfully demented, throwing everything they can think of at us, eventually leaving the least amount of room for a sequel that a film could possibly leave in its wake. It's a welcome change of pace from the boring mob of pointless sequel bait.It's a truly wonderful thing to behold. That's enough gushing on my part*: go see it.*No pun intended",True
86005,23 December 2008,laurencu,Rumor Has It... (2005),8.0,"I bought the DVD really cheap a few months back, and I thought I'd decide to eventually watch it because I was bored. I didn't expect much. So when I came on this bored I was very surprised a lot of people hated this movie.I can see the sides to the people who hate this, I really can, but some how you shouldn't take a movie too seriously. It was fun to watch. I agree it wasn't that funny, not funny at all, but I still loved it.Yeah, I thought it was pretty disturbing about how she kissed her ""dad"", but you can see they were obviously drunk, and when Sarah woke up she couldn't believe what had happened. I disagree they didn't have any chemistry. I could see that they did.I thought it was very warming how after all of this, Sarah is closer to her family. At the start she wants a relationship with adventure. So she gets that. But she realises she wouldn't want to settle down with someone just about adventure - just like her mum. After, she realises she wants to settle down with Jeff.We, or I, can see clearly that she is now close with her family. After all that, she finally learnt about her mum, and can see clear.I do agree of how Jeff could take her back. I think he loved her unconditionally. Even in these situations, even if your partner does something bad, sometimes you still love them and want to take them back. Jeff realised she was truly sorry, and thus running after her. I believe in almost every relationship there is always going to be a down-fall.***Like I said***, I do agree why people hate this, but I didn't expect much and just enjoyed it for what it was.

This story actually came from the scribe of the novel version of the Wizard of Oz, and has Santa...who was known then just as Claus, raised by immortal fairy folk, lead by the Great Ak, who looks like Odin of Norse Mythology and has a silver axe that shoots lasers, and cared for by a mountain lion...yeah you just read that right. The story follows Santa from his adoption into the fairy folks world to his last days as a mortal, where is invents toys... yes that is right Claus invented toys people... and he needed to defend himself from the evil Agwas, a band of weird demons who hate children and toys, even though Claus invented them only like 30 years prior.

86164,23 December 2008,tomrdiehl,The War of the Worlds (2005 Video),1.0,"Okay, to sum my setup up: On Sunday, I watched Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds. That one was okay. On Monday, I saw this year's War of the Worlds 2 because I thought the first three minutes didn't look too bad in the preview. It was horrible and pointless. So, today is Tuesday and it is the last of the three new versions of WotW, casually counting the 2008 one as close enough to the missing 2005 one.This couldn't be that bad, I thought. Really, I've seen war of the Worlds 2 before. How could this possibly be worse?Well, let's see: So the movie started. Classic start for a WotW movie: A narrator reads some of the first lines of the book (with a few unnecessarily added in). Every movie needs to set itself apart from the others and this already does it well: By using a reader that obviously had just been taught reading two hours before recording. An honorable deed to fight dyslexia, really appreciable for that guy, yet less for us. After borderline dyslexic narrator talked far too long, we hear the characters talk. And it is seamlessly the funniest dialog in any movie ever. I mean, the terrible fake British accent even offends me - and I'm German!On second thought, it matches the nameless main character's mustache (sadly as nameless as the protagonist himself). Both will continue an impressive competition in being more hilariously fake than the other. But despite doing its best, the mustache has no chance. Well, I have to admit, the accent cheated: Hardly anybody but the protagonist bears a mustache cut out of a piece of black carpet while the abominable Angloscotmerican is omnipresent and even gets help by the script, replacing ""unconscious"" with ""insensible"" on every chance. Which is, despite fitting the acting pretty well as a description, just hilarious. You might think I stress this too much, but I really think this is the main story of the movie: The fakedness of a 'stache and an accent on a man who walks a lot. The Martians are really mere red herrings to this.Oh, right, walking. Almost forgot about that. Many others have complained about the protagonist walking too much. I think this is part of a therapy, because whenever he encounters something larger than an anthill he will stumble and fall right down and when he actually manages to walk in a straight line, he does it so stiffly, he has to look out for passing entomologist who might mistake him for a walking stick and try to catch him. I almost forgot: Adding insult to injury, the main protagonist actually seems to be Freddie Mercury. No, really, same mustache, chest hair, figure; they frigging revived Freddie Mercury as a zombie and made him play this. That actually explains a lot about this film, including the weird walking - because of the zombie part, off course, no disrespect to Mercury here.Come to think of it, this movie looks a lot ***like the video for Radio GaGa, especially after Freddie takes off his shirt for no reason at all, walking around like the aforementioned*** stick insect on a Playgirl photo shoot. Plus men getting very touchy all the time, which also explains the lack of children with all married couples shown. Same cardboard houses as decoration, an atmosphere that somewhat resembles German expressionism movies like Metropolis and Nosferatu, overacting, even coloring the whole picture to indicate time of day (as done in Nosferatu) and jumps between day and night within minutes. Holy celluloid roll, this is intentional! Timothy Hines, the maker of this movie, probably thought this is what movies looked like at the turn of the century. You see kids, this is why you should not try to force your works into being art: If you have to call something art to sell it, it is probably really, really stupid or bad. Or both. Things only get worse if it is supposed to be an homage to something.The ending bears two interesting details. For one, despite being three hours long, it is still too short, as evidenced by a pointless side-story about Freddie Mercury's brother (who looks like Freddie without the 'stache) and two women that goes nowhere except showing a ship firing at Martians with some unmanned guns and probably used to have an ending of some sorts at one point of development. And the other detail: The credits actually advertise the next flick by Pendragon Pictures, called Chrome - no thanks.Also: The SFX are so laughable I won't even mention them. BUT: Is it really necessary to shoot cart rides against a green-screen and replace it with ridiculously mismatching background? I mean, you could have just taken the camera and film the people on the cart while they were riding. On the other hand, the camera man makes holding a camera straight seem more like rocket science than I ever imagined (ironical in a film that features machines called tripods so prominently, isn't it?). Also, I would never have guessed it looked that funny when a woman was stepped on by a giant walking machine.So, to sum this all up: This is a movie about Freddie Mercury's revived corps playing a walking stick in a bad homo-erotic movie, sublimely revolving around a conflict between his facial hair and voice while aimlessly wandering around the fierce British desert. Also, it has Martians that look like paper cut-outs of themselves. If this isn't art, I don't know what.Go watch it, it is hilarious. I promise, I din't even scratch the surface of hilarity in this one.PS: What exactly does a stellar configuration look like in which Mars is ""sunwards"". And how is being closer to the sun a reason for being colder? Did I miss some really crucial astrology classes?",True

To have someone on the same screen, where CSI consistently bores us with 15 minute crime action and ""Who wants to be Paris Hilton Today"" shows, come to life and start hammering confusion and challenging thoughts into the public. Why don't you all complain of that?I only hope these messages get stronger.So again, I hate Television. I hate most TV shows. This was special for me. Maybe they all have something special, but this in particular. Had something unique and great and even transcended history. You could LEARN of REAL EVENTS that HAVE happened in this. Almost everything in this episode is based on a factual occurrence.***Like i said***, maybe they all do that, but this one had a VERY IMPORTANT message that the above/previous commenter most definitely MISSED.One Hour Photo was good for OTHER REASONS. It was a piece of ART and a complete mind bender. THIS. This is easy and simple for the sheep in their living rooms or beds who think Lindsay Lohan is anything relevant. Maybe it can help some mental stragglers wake up a little more...Check it out.",True

86461,24 December 2008,alexander_walsh,The Family Stone (2005),9.0,"I think the movie was great. When I saw it in theaters originally, I was forced to see it and didn't like it as much. Since then, however, I have seen it many times and I think it's a great character based film. There is so much to see in it that you only get by seeing it many times. In one scene in particular, the two brothers, Everett and Ben, look at one another without even saying much at all, and yet, their non-verbals say everything. The shot lasts for about three or four seconds, but it may be one of the best ones in the film. Every character is one you want to root for (some more than others, though) and even the smallest details give you insight into these people's lives. When the father drags the sun away after he wakes up with his brother's girlfriend, when the two brother's fight turns into laughing and roughhousing, when the oldest sister realizes her mother's illness It was all written very well. A lot of time went into the making of this film, and I think a lot of people didn't really give it a chance because they expected it to be a romantic comedy when it was really a family drama. We can blame the advertising for that.As for the bad reviews of this film: Please do not take everything they say seriously. When people see a movie they do not like, they are more apt to write bad reviews. Those who liked this film probably fell asleep on a couch in front of a fire as the end credits rolled across the screen. I do understand, though, the complaint about how much changed in a 24 hour period within the movie. In this story, though, I think it was believable. I mean, a lot can change in a single moment alone. When the son brought his girlfriend home, he already knew in the back of his mind that he wasn't meant for her. It wasn't an entire life changing moment. He just needed something the push him to his realization. That came in a day. (Also, must we forget that this film jumped to a year later? A lot can happen in a year.Understanding change like this will help you to enjoy films that may not have originally been your cup of tea, and, in turn, will help you enjoy life more. Attacking a movie is ***like attacking a chocolate fudge sundae (I believe Kurt Vonnegut said*** something like that).Those who liked this film were happy letting this film simply entertain them for a few hours of their life.

I wont give you details. this film must be seen at least 2 times, ***like one poster said*** i am the only one around me that has seen this movie and i cant talk about it, acting by all is top notch.

It's not a secret that this movie was inspired by those films, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Actually I think if you liked those films, you'll like this one too. Maybe it's not that good, but it has more gangs, more colorful characters and much more action sequences (mayebe even better action sequences). Since Mad Max have already showed us what the future is going to be like, this movie gives us an opportunity to travel around a post-apocalyptic wastelands to get to know better this kind of world and to experience all sorts of adventures. There's all sorts of different characters like cyborgs, lonely wasteland warriors, infected people and many others. ***Like I already have mentioned***, this movie has a lot of great action. There's some great car-chase scenes, which were surprisingly well made and looked very exiting. Also there was lot's of fighting scenes, with some great acrobatic tricks and the fighters sometimes used strange looking weapons, which cosed lots of blood and some chopped-off limbs. Shoot-outs were great too, only there was too little of them. The acting (if you care about the acting) was good, actually there was lots of great actors in this film, though not many of them are known today. So if you are fan of post-apocalyptic movies, you just have to watch this one.",True

You know what, in life we often talk, not because we have to, not because it's important, but just like that. And we don't always keep our promises - the things happen in an unexpected way, or we reconsider at some point, or simply don't care to.You know what I find really boring? The hour-and-half Hollywood movies, in which people speak what they are supposed to, do what are supposed to do, and everything is predictable from the first five-or-so minutes. It's refreshing to see a movie in which the heroine can take a break and simply talk to somebody. Makes her alive, I suppose... more vital than Black Knight or V.Oh, and there isn't a finale grande, with a long sword fight. So what? Honestly, if I was to write The End, she wouldn't even kill Bill, just take her daughter and go away. Maybe even sue for the house or moral injuries :) (or whatever you call it in US).",True

86739,25 December 2008,kurciasbezdalas,Ninja Warriors (1985),10.0,"If you are ninja fan, then you know how hard it is to find a decent ninja-movie. There is American Ninja series which is my favorite ninja-movies. Also there is Sho Kosugi movies, which are good, but usually there's too little of ninja action. There's also Gotfrey Ho ninja-movies, which are not bad too, but by watching these films you get a 30% of ninja movie and 70% of totally different film, which is not always interesting. There's also Kung Fu Vs. Ninja movies, which are usually more Kung Fu than ninja films. Ninja Warriors is a 100% ninja movie. I've read other comments on this film and I agree with all of them. Yes, the plot is lame (since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, people start thinking that martial arts movie, needs to have a plot, funny isn't it?). Yes the acting is lame too, (since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, people start thinking that martial arts movie, needs to have great acting in it too). Some other things in the movie were silly, but that isn't important. What's important that this movie has a lot of ninjas, who were demonstrating their skills. The fighting scenes were great, though sometimes it was too short, but at least it looked effective on screen. I love Ron Marchini movies, maybe he isn't a good actor, but he is a great martial artist. I've seen his other movie which is called Death Machines, where his character didn't said a word through the whole movie, but fighting instead of it and that was great. Romano Kristoff looked kinda cool as a bad guy and I think his acting was pretty good. This movie isn't meant to be taking serious and I think that people who made this film knew how silly it is. I think they had a sense of humor. There was that drunken old man who was singing ""happy birthday to me"" and invited a ninja girl to a party, now wasn't that funny? The last 15 minutes were pure ninja fighting sequences with no dialogs at all. There were lots of great ninja tricks demonstrated on this film. Some of them were really clever. There also was a lot of acrobatic stunts and that looked very impressive. The direction was pretty good too. There also was one hara-kiri scene, which reminded me of those good old Japanese samurai films. So ***like I said***, it's a 100% ninja movie and I love it. It has everything that ninja movie needs and even more. If you are looking for some great ninja movie, this is it. I wish there was more this kinda of films, because most of the ninja films are disappointing.",True

I saw a commercial or two and was enamored because I really enjoyed ""Sin City"" and appreciated ""300,"" both for their stories and their art direction. Unfortunately, art direction is pretty much all this movie has to offer.My girlfriend and I came into the theater excited to see this movie. From the very opening sequence the cinematography was beautiful, all green screen and highly stylized with great shadowing and excellent ambiance. Although it looked beautiful, it almost seemed like a joke from the very start. The script was downright terrible and devoid of any feeling evoking anything other than skepticism. In the first few scenes you see The Spirit, obviously the protagonist, fighting The Octopus...an evil villain played by Samuel L. Jackson...I'll leave it at I was so disappointed that both me and my girlfriend decided to leave the film because the quirky sense of humor this movie evokes is not only out of place, but almost a mockery of the stream-of-consciousness writing that has made Frank Miller so well-renowned.***Like I said***, I walked out. Great visuals, horrible horrible direction which mutilated Jackson's acting talents and made Scarlet Johanssen almost unwatchable. Save your money and wait for the DVD.",True
86917,25 December 2008,greasemeyer,Once Upon a Forest (1993),8.0,"I wish movies like these were still made.Usually, animated movies like these don't find my favor, neither do I remember them very long. However, there's something about this one that somehow touches my heart. I first saw this video when I was about 8 years old, maybe a little older, 10 at the most. Years later, My younger brother, about 9, wanted to watch this video. I was 16 then, and at first, I had no interest in watching the movie. But then I remembered watching it years ago, and thought, oh, what the heck, I'm not doing anything today. So I watched it. Things that I paid no attention to when I was young I now watched closely. The introduction, transitions, quality of the video, the story, and reality of the video and characters. Even though this video is over 15 years old, it still had exceptionally good quality for a VHS tape. The characters are so real, you like them instantly. When I say real, I mean being able to tell the difference between a male and a female mouse, badger, and other critters that were in this movie. The young furlings start out as typical kids, mischievous and selfish. This leads to a few minor consequences. Eventually, they realize the danger and the reality of the real world out there, for example, the road. Now, I could get picky and say the car, tanker truck, ""Yellow Dragons"", and the humans did not look very realistic, but hey! This video isn't based on those things, so why judge the movie by that?When Michelle falls sick, the other young furlings realize the need to work together, get along, share, obey rules, and never give up. The songs, especially ""Please Wake Up"" were very touching, and even brought tears to my eyes. I liked how the furlings learned to respect their elders, so to speak, such as Uncle Cornelias, who was very wise. They balanced to movie very well with suspense and action.The end brought tears to my eyes once again, as it was very touching. It is an animated film and yet it brings out the reality of life. The only few things I would have done differently are these:1. If I was uncle Cornelius, I would have been much more upset with the furlings after they did foolish things, especially, when it ruins long periods of work. 2. It would have been nice to see Abigail with Willy again, since they liked each other. I thought for sure he would return to the picture towards the end, but never saw him. 3. It was really sad to leave Michelle without a Mommy or Daddy.Those are the only things I would have done differently. ***Like I said***, I wish Fox still made good movies like this one. The new animated movies have much better graphics, but the stories usually aren't the greatest, and they tend to add humor and content that isn't really appropriate for children.",True
87218,5 September 2020,mjdoyle001,Tenet (2020),9.0,"One of the best cinema-going experiences I've ever had. The 'inversion' aspect really isn't that hard to grasp, however the story itself will make you work to understand it. The set pieces are un***like anything I've seen before, and I thought the cast and acting were understated*** and intriguing, exactly what a film with these themes requires.
Personally I didn't have an issue with sound or understanding dialogue; the overall mix feels raw and punchy, further immersing you into this world. The score is one of the best I've heard (and felt!) - Razor sharp synths with a sinuous blend of organic and electronic textures, tribal beats and cavernous bass. Awesome! I personally didn't think this film was too loud, rather that how Nolan has mixed down the elements plays with 'perceived loudness'. Not only will the story and visuals challenge you, the sound design will as well.
It's a visceral film that will hammer your senses and if you're looking for an easy going experience with the usual linear story-tropes and score, then this is not for you...Perhaps wait for Bond to reappear in November? I'm not knocking Bond but it's hardly unfamiliar territory.

87458,5 September 2020,NSWSteamFanReviews04,An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991),8.0,"Let's see what I actually think of this followup to Don Bluth's 1986 classic. Is it good? Is it bad? Let's take a look.Well, probably the worst aspect of this film is it's sudden shift in tone from the first film. We should expect that as Don Bluth is nowhere to be found in the credits. But when you hear that Steven Spielberg actually returned to produce this film, something different should've happened. It should've kept the serious tone and themes of it's predecessor. But instead, it just goes for this Looney Tunes style western cartoon that makes little to no sense. It's just like making a sequel to Watership Down and turning it into a Silly Symphony cartoon (come to think about it, we should've expected a direct-to-video Watership Down sequel in the 90s). I mean, this looks like something made for the direct-to-video market without any involvement from the cast and crew of the previous film. But when you hear that Spielberg actually had confidence in this movie, you know this is gonna be a weird start for his short-lived animation studio.Leaving behind the sudden shift from a Disney-style classic to a Warner Bros.-esque cartoon, let's see what happened with the characters. They're passable; Fievel (voiced by Phillip Glasser) for some reason has this dream to be a cowboy in the west, Tiger (voiced by Dom DeLuise) is still funny, Cat R. Waul (voiced by John Cleese) is the British-sounding bad guy, T.R. Chula (voiced by Jon Lovitz) is the comical henchmen of the bad guys, Tanya (voiced by Cathy Cavadini) suddenly has this dream to become a singer, Miss Kitty (voiced by Amy Irving) is passable but not really interesting aside from her not really being part of the previous film, Wylie Burp (voiced by James Stewart in his final role) is the main character's hero, and that's it. What's interesting to know is that while the characters from the first film retain their Sullivan-Bluth Studios designs, the new characters defer and look like they came from, again, a Looney Tunes cartoon.Speaking of the designs, let's take a look at the best aspect of the film; the animation. This is some of the best and most colorful animation put into the big screen in the early 90s. I know some Don Bluth fans might hate the animation, but the visuals are amazing. The colors look alive, the frame-rate makes the cartoony gags more hilarious, and the elephant in the room is the moving camera shots. The painted 360 backgrounds show that you don't always need 3D technology to make the shot rotate. Sure the characters don't always align well, but who cares? Steven Spielberg succeeded at his goal of wanting the film to look impressive without the usage of computer-animation, which Disney was already using for some of the backgrounds of their films at the time. Anyway, if I was to explain why one would want to check out this film, it's the top-quality animation. I hope those artists at Amblimation still have a job doing what they do best. Phil Nibbelink shows his true talent in this film with some delightful cartoon visuals that he would later show in Steven Speilberg's next animated film We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story.Another reason why the animation works really well is the humor and gags. ***Like I said***, the gags in this film are usually cartoony, like when Cat R. Waul takes a bite out of his sandwich not knowing that the mouse in it was replaced by a wooden puppet and he freezes for a bit and spits it out. There's also that chase around New York City when Tiger is trying to make it to the train while also evading some dogs. The scene is not only visually stunning, but also hilarious with the cartoony logic. The humor is funny on it's own, but it definitely shines with the animation.I also like the soundtrack. We have some memorable tracks composed once again by the late James Horner. What I love about his soundtrack is that it mixes comedic music with some epic western music, such as the ""In Training"" track heard before the climax. But do you want to know what's better than the music? The musical numbers. Yes, this is once again a musical. And for a sequel, the songs are actually amazing. While for some reason we hear the Blues Brothers version of Rawhide in a weird journey montage, he have some original songs written by James Horner and Will Jennings. I couldn't get ""Way Out West"" and ""The Girl You Left Behind"" out of my head. Probably the best song from this movie was ""Dreams to Dream,"" which was actually eligible for an Oscar nomination just like ""Somewhere Out There"" in the previous film despite not receiving any.Props to the voice acting as well. Phillip Glasser does a brilliant job once again as Fievel, Dom DeLuise was still hilarious as Tiger, John Cleese must've been having an amazing time in the studio as Cat R. Waul and James Steward in his final role was amazing as Wylie Burp. The only actor who's acting I'm kind of mixed on is John Lovitz' voice as T.R. Chula. He sounded like he was having a blast, but at the same time his voice as that cartoony spider can get annoying.In conclusion, I would recommend this to film to anyone except Don Bluth fans. I know they would hate it, especially fans of An American Tail. But for anyone else, especially children, this is something worth at least one watch. I mean, it's not good. But it was still not a bad start for Steven Spielberg's long gone Amblimation studio. It's weird and over-the-top, but the animation, humor and music make this a worthwhile experience.",True

88114,21 February 2016,jim-612-428779,500 MPH Storm (2013),1.0,Wow If I could figure a way to give this a lower rating I would. My god. I watched it on a pay per view streaming a couple years ago. I can Not get it out of my head and like a very bad commercial Jingle but the whole movie is that way. I felt I had to watch it as I had paid for it. But I will never do this again. Some spoiler points. That teenage kid. ***As someone said*** they would have thrown him out of the car. Not to mention they left a dog to die. Not cool. No point in Not saving the dog. There was room in the car. The Chopper taking off to get out of the fire. Well. I just cannot say how badly done that was. Wrong engine sound. I actually saw the folks that made this movie. Did not meet them as they were too full of themselves. When Someone wanted to make an announcement these idiots would not shut up even thought they were made aware that someone wanted to make an announcement. I will not say what else they did that was extremely rude. But now I fully understand in the movie if you can call it a movie they leave the dog to die. And they would have left the dog and anyone else to die in real life I think based on the arrogance. I like to make fun of poorly done B movies. But I have no words for this one. I could not make fun of it. I feel sorry for it somehow but at the same time I want to destroy all the 0s and 1s in computer code that make up this abortion. I can not call this a B movie. If there were a rating of A to F I would give it an F. But there is only one movie as bad. Plan Nine from outer space. But at least that had some character. It was dreadfully painful but this movie is still causing pain years later. The poor actors. Well At least the head actor I think may be a good actor. But must have been as someone else pointed out held at gun point and made to act. And the shot of him in a strong wind holding onto the lip of a man hole that was not even a man hole was played for a long time. As if it was some miraculous shot that no one on earth could have ever done and that anyone seeing it would want a poster of it. So you kind of get a poster as they just keep showing it. I am pretty sure it is the longest shot even done. Or it was just so bad that It felt like it. Now if you want a B movie that is good in my opinion. Watch a movie called Razorback. You can NOT not like this movie. In Fact. It is the best Movie ever made....... about a man eating hog. So even if you are NOT into man eating hog movies you will still like it.,True
88171,21 February 2016,burlesonjesse5,Exposed (III) (2016),3.0,"Unknown director (with a pseudonym to boot). Generic title. Big name stars who you sense are doing it for a paycheck. Released by way of video on demand instead of theatrical. Sound familiar? It should. If you've seen reviews for movies like The Prince or Vice, then Exposed (my latest write-up) is embedded in that category. Yeah it's lousy ***like the aforementioned*** vehicles but in a different way. Vice and ""Prince"" have a sense of coherency. You can mostly follow their every beat. Exposed is just messy. There were times when I didn't know what it was that I saw. So OK, what were you thinking Mira Sorvino? What were you thinking Michael Rispoli? And Christopher McDonald, what the heck?Anyway, watching this thing is like viewing two different films at once. I don't know how to classify it. You could call Exposed a nonprofessional indie. You could call it a crime drama/supernatural charade. Heck, you could claim it to be a foreign language flick starring Keanu ""whoa"" Reeves (huh?). No matter how you interpret things, there's 102 minutes here that feel like 3 hours. When its best performance is given by a washed-up, recluse rapper (Big Daddy Kane), you know the proceedings are in trouble. When its opening sequence takes forever and sets a bad precedent for what lies ahead, you know the proceedings are in trouble. And finally, when its director doesn't want to reveal his (or her) actual name, you know the proceedings are in trouble. Exposed can easily be renamed, Excruciating.Speaking of said director, he may be a rookie or he may be a veteran. Either way, Declan Dale (or whatever his name is) lets you know it's amateur night right off the bat. It's clear from the opening credits (of Exposed) that he can't effectively set up a shot, can't frame a scene, doesn't know when to infuse a close-up, doesn't know where to put the camera, doesn't use a zoom out at the right time, and can't juggle his many, muddled subplots. Scenes in Exposed are either too long-winded or not nearly long enough. And Dale's editing team could have been a pack of monkeys and the audience wouldn't even know the difference. Tone is absent, dramatic momentum starts up only to get sucked into the wind, and laughable overacting comes on like gangbusters. I paid $6.99 to watch this movie on XFINITY. If I paid $1.50 for it on Redbox, it still would have been a bad investment.Filmed in an uncommon part of New York City, distributed by Lionsgate Premiere, and originally titled Daughter of God, Exposed jots back and forth to chronicle the lives of two different, combative characters. First we have Scott Galban (played by Keanu Reeves). He is your typical, doom and gloom detective. His wife passed away, his son has been taken from him, he has almost no friends, and his partner (Joey Cullen played by Danny Hoch) just got murdered in an underground subway. Galban against mild orders from his superior (Lt. Galway played by Christopher McDonald), investigates the reality of his partner's death. He goes around asking questions yet every witness he talks to, gets murdered. Second, there's Isabel de La Cruz (played by Ana de Armas). She's the only witness that Galban hasn't talked to yet. Her character is borderline schizo. She becomes pregnant by way of a miracle, she has visions of ghostly apparitions, there's a side plot about her husband being stationed in Iraq, and she ultimately wanders the film as though she's a lost puppy. Throughout Exposed, we as the audience see Isabel the most (even though her and Keanu's Scott are loosely connected). Many frustrating scenes involve Isabel, her family, and her friends constantly gabbing in Spanish (when all of them obviously speak English). As for Reeves, well we only discern his screen time in bits and pieces. His presence is never developed or consistent. ***Like I mentioned*** in the second paragraph, Exposed feels like you're watching two separate vignettes altogether. They're so unconnected from each other, it makes the film totally shapeless. When every plot element finally comes full circle (in the concluding clips), you feel the damage has already been done. Exposed ""exposes"" itself to be a real scrape. Rating: 1 and a half stars.Of note: A lot of death occurs in Exposed yet we never see it. Heck, we don't even view any of the actual aftermath. It's like the film is trying to be 1995's Se7en but is too lazy to explain how A led to B. Is it possible the studios didn't want to go over budget? Maybe. Is it possible director Dale didn't know how to make homicide scenes look believable? Maybe so. Or did the special effects crew run out of fake blood? Oh yeah, that's it. Yeesh! Also of note: I usually give Keanu Reeves a pass because a lot of moviegoers think he can't act. I've seen him do solid work in Point Break, Speed, and Street Kings. I know what he's capable of. In Exposed however, he hits a wall by showing us the ultimate, wooden moment. There's a scene where he sits in his police car, gets upset, shows frustration, yells at himself, and bangs his hands on the steering wheel. To say this is laughable would be an understatement.",True
88181,21 February 2016,acomabutterfly,Outsiders (I) (2016– ),9.0,"I was an avid SOA fan, and though this show has some similarities to the plot line of SOA there is so much more in the underline of the show. If it keeps going the way it has then we are in for a fantastic show. In the first episode I admit it was a bit slow but that was just the introduction of the characters and to the way of life for both the townies and the mountain people. It also introduced the fact that the mountain itself has magic. Which reminded me of Avatar. The inner politics reminded me of GOT. I am not saying that it was copied on the contrary I believe that this show has allot left to give. Asa: why did he leave in the first place, what made him want to kill himself and why did the wolves choose him to go back.What happened 25 years ago for the sheriff to believe that it was the Farrells that killed his father, the story behind what connects him to the protection of the mountain men.Who is the little girl with the butterfly and what is her role in the show.Why would the Ferrell wine make the boy see his father as the devil, can only the Ferrell's drink it and not be affected? or is the wine made from the mountain actually helping the mountain people?There is also a certain socialism that is being addressed in the show that makes it something important to watch. Asa calls himself and the clan 9th class citizens. This is how allot of people are still seen because of the lack of book education, but ***like the deputy sheriff stated***, they know things on the mountain that the townies don't even remember the names of.There are many more reasons and plots within plots that I find interesting. I don't understand how a show like Supernatural can stay on the air for over 11 years with no substance and a very thin story line but a show with depth that will actually make you think in many different areas is being chastised like this. This is only my opinion. I am sure others will see it different.",True

Those words are music to my ears... On that note, the music is also very good, as is the dialogue, acting, and overall execution of the show. I mean, geez, it's downright rare that a show achieves all of these hurdles.I'd also like to comment on Toby Stephens' electrifying portrayal of Captain Flint. ***Like I said***, the acting is great all around, and the actors themselves seem to work well together, but Stephens in particular was born for this role. Give an episode a watch. It's obvious that the show has been created by a team of dedicated professionals.

88388,21 February 2016,rouhu,Deadpool (2016),8.0,"Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a mercenary who falls in love lives a happy life until he finds that he has cancer. A mysterious man offers help in a form of an experiment that will cure Wades cancer. The experiment turns out to be making super slaves instead. It makes him invulnerable but also scars his whole body so Wade takes a new identity: Deadpool and starts his quest for revenge. Along the way we meet supporting characters like blind Al and even a few X-Men, Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus, and yes, the lack of X-Men is addressed in the film: ""Wow, this is such a big house, but I only ever see the two of you here. It's like the studio didn't have enough money for any more X-Men..."". The film has been in development since February 2004, so this is a very anticipated film for many (including me), and, I'm happy to say: it is very good. Deadpool is filled with crude humor from the opening credits that announce that the film is directed by an ""overpaid tool"" until the very end. The film is rated R (who even suggested that Deadpool should be pg-13?), and the thing contributing to this, aside the humor, is the over the top violence. Bones break, limbs get cut off and blood sprays and its awesome! This movie is a success so I hope other movies would have the courage to be R rated if appropriate (looking at you Suicide Squad). The fight scenes are all well choreographed especially the one opening the film that also establishes the tone of the film with jokes like this:"" I never say this... but don't swallow"" and people beaten to pulp. The film also constantly breaks the fourth wall and references other like when Wade comments:"" Please don't make the super suit green. OR ANIMATED!"" a jab to Green Lantern, also starring Reynolds. The music is also very good, with most of it being rap, which really fits this film, Deadpool even gets his own rap! Deadpool comics have always been as funny as they are gory, so I can imagine that the fans of Merc with a Mouth will be pleased. Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool. He has showed great interest towards the character. His enthusiasm shows in his performance, he is funny, witty and a fast talker. All the cast members get at least one big funny moment as well and play their characters well. There are parts in Deadpool that left me wanting more. The plot is something that audiences have seen in a lot of movies , since there are a lot of films about revenge. A lot of the film is shot ***like this: there is a shot of someone saying a funny line, then cut to someone reaction to said*** joke. I felt like the filmmakers could have more added visual jokes or make the movie more interesting visually so the film would have been as funny visually as it was with its dialogue. The villain is also a bit boring with Ed Skrein playing him a bit too stoically for this kind of movie. Overall Deadpool is a fun time with a few flaws, but I still think it is a good start for a possible franchise and that fans will love it!",True

Indeed, I watched two movies which were a reaction to his over the last couple of years, and the idiots who did the film used essentially the very same style that Moore uses. In other words, ***like spoiled kids, they said***, ""Moore does such and such,"" and did exactly the same thing, but Michael had done it first.And most of his films have a comic element, if not also mixed with at least a touch of ego. That's okay. He made the movie, and I didn't. Heaven knows lots more of my ego might be in it if I'd made it...But I did anticipate a ""comedy"" with this film. That's the way it's advertised. It started very cleverly, thought I don't want to spoil anything by saying how. And I laughed from the beginning. He travels from one country to another and finds: Well, it seems their citizens mean more to the government of those countries than ours do to our government! Even one Muslim country--the name of which I won't mention here. But the women of that land took a stand against the Conservative Muslim government, and won! A highlight: Micheal was able to talk with that Muslim president of that country who said, I think in these words, ""Power isn't everything."" Bravo!Then, at the end, after a couple hours of reflecting on the great elements of these countries, Micheal reminds us that, AS EVEN THE OFFICIALS IN THOSE COUNTRIES ASSERT, WHAT THEY PRACTICE AND PREACH THEY GOT FROM America!So, those who are inclined, like some of my extended family to contend that Moore is ""anti-American,"" that's nonsense. He reminds us of what were were, and CAN BE.Then why only 8 stars? The only problem I had with it was that it was slightly ""post-modern."" For example, of all the banks in Iceland, the only one that didn't collapse was run by women. He deduces that, therefore, if the world were run more by women, it would be more just. One of the woman Iceland officials said, ""It's in our DNA."" With that I disagree. First, doubtless, the worst boss I ever had was a woman. And arguably the second worst was a black woman. The issue is that of POWER, not sex, not race, not just breaking what's been typical, i.e., male, Caucasian, heterosexual. Aside from that, it's another classic I'll purchase and add to my Michael Moore library once it's released on DVD.",True
88518,21 February 2016,mbrandon011,Interns of F.I.E.L.D. (2016– ),3.0,"This show is such a curious topic for me. Having been a subscriber to Screen Junkies for a few years now, loving their Honest Trailers and SUPER loving their Movie Fights i must of been one of the first to subscribe to Screen Junkies Plus (where this show can be watched). Even dedicated my 2016 amateur editing vid to them on my youtube channel mbrandon11. Some decent shows on SJ+, not least of all ""What's in the Box"" with Kevin Smith & Jason Mewes, very funny and some other shows that aren't bad at all. All in all worth the 2year subscription fee. On top of all that the creators clearly have talent in their ideas, nice dudes, funny and extremely knowledgeable of all things movie related so guess the first downfall for me was having very high expectations. Without getting into the plot as you can really go read about that anywhere in much greater detail than i can spell out, I don't think anything hit for me. The awkwardness behind the jokes seem to be trying to aim for some of the great ideas behind such comedies like ""The Office"" yet pull characters such as ""Black Skull"" straight out of the campiest 90's cartoon series like ""HE-Man"". So very quickly we seem to be subjected to humour that just doesn't seem to flow correctly from the characters which, for me, left a real feeling of disjointed chemistry anytime characters were talking to each other.With the short runtime of each episode this is a big problem and found that there was no way to recover from it and truly limited any love you could feel towards the characters. So when a show ***like this relies very heavily on said*** characters and writing, rather than any continuous action or big set pieces it certainly leaves a lot to be desired.That all being said the idea was/is great, effort is fantastic and the fact this is a first written project for these guys means i'm sure they'll be kicking on and getting better from here but for me personally this really didn't do it on any level and I did truly want this to be great.

Jada Pinkett Smith blew me away, I thought she did a fantastic job here! Also Matt bomber Channing Tatum Joe and Amber heard all did a great job! You could really tell that everyone was just so passionate about this movie and really cared a lot when they were making it! Now as for the choreography and the stripping and the hot dancing, they freaking nailed it! The stripper sequences were so sexy and well choreographed!

She was spot on with the lines and sexy mature dialogue! God her part was just so well written! And ***like I said*** before, the writing is well written and very dramatic. I absolutely loved the great chemistry between all the characters! I mean all cast members were so close and had really awesome relationships.

So far so good, ***like a score of other films, but JeruZalem delivers (way) better than average of said*** movies on all the usual dimensions. In addition we have a rather fresh take on things, the glass idea works like a charm and explains wonderfully why ""the camera"" is always on. Realistic dialogue and slow building up, where we get to know the characters and ""smell"" the atmosphere of the city (I rarely feel as if I am really there, but I did with this one). Some hints at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (seen in the tensions between IDF and Muslim characters), the feeling of increasing danger and imminent doom, which is there all the way from the start, but growing slowly and unstoppable. The effects are great, and for those who pay attention throughout, the appearance and behavior of the monsters follow logically (if that word can be used here). The missing brother background story has it's purpose as well, and the complaints about protagonist fall on hollow ground: She is acting realistically, and if you take into account her behavior early in the film, what she is doing when the horror is setting in for real is no surprise. Great movie!",True
88867,22 February 2016,ElMaruecan82,Spotlight (I) (2015),9.0,"Tom McCarthy's ""Spotlight"" is one of these movies that are either loved or hated for the wrong reasons. Wherever your faith stands, it is not a charge against the Roman Catholic Church, but members of the Archdiocese who covered up ongoing child molestations and protected incriminated priests. The film's goal is less to make people question their faith on God, than on the men in charge of their faith. Ultimately, the Church's greatest enemy becomes the Church itself.And the film's brilliant screenplay erases all the controversy in one single line and I salute Tom McCarthy, the director of Catholic background, and co-writer with Josh singer, to have very intelligently made his point through one simple exchange. Reporter Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) is talking to one of the victims, and the man says he still considers himself a Catholic. How so? Mike asks. It's simple, the Catholic Church is an Institution, made by men, and men pass by while faith is eternal. Mike, a Catholic like many members of the 'Spotlight' unit, doesn't get it, but at least the point is made: the priests who commit these crimes were criminal and the whole investigation aims the accomplices, which leas to another masterstroke of writing: the portrayal of the 'villain'.Wait, what villain? Did I miss something? Was there a bad guy in the film? Not outside the script as McCarthy deliberately avoided depicting the incriminated Cardinal Law as a physical presence in the film, in order to avoid the presence of a polarizing villain. And sometimes, the invisibility of the 'bad guy' makes his influence even more fearsome, especially when, as the investigations progresses, the journalists understand it's not just about the Church, it's a whole system that is involved. And you can feel it from the directing, Boston, the Catholic city, the birthplace of the Kennedys, the setting of ""The Verdict"" another thrilling courtroom drama with religious figures in cause, this Boston is a great city, but it feels rather small and confined in ""Spotlight"", as to convey a sense of paranoid entrapment, you know like ""what happens in Boston, stays in Boston"".And this is exactly how the sexual abuses spread widely and became a pattern that would forever soil the image of the Church. No one took the responsibility, no one faced the facts, no lawyers had the guts to appeal to court and no journalist dared to dig deeper in the case, including the Globe, it was all settled privately. Everyone is responsible, and this is why the film's impartiality isn't to be challenged, they're all part of the same hypocrisy and ***like Mitchell Garabedian, Stanley Tucci as the lawyer who wrote*** a column accusing Cardinal Law of covering up a priest, ""it takes a city to raise a child, it takes a city to abuse one"". And I guess this is why it will take an outsider to start all over again. It's not too late after all, to make up lost time.Marty Barone (Liev Schreiber) is the new editor of the Globe, and sees the Garabedian's column as the tree that hides the forest. He asks the 'Spotlight' investigate unit, lead by 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton) to investigate. Thanks to Rezendes' tenacity, Geberian blows the whistle and give other names, and the snowball effect leads to a series of convocations, door-knocks, interviews with the victims, lawyers who were in charge of the case, and from a few priests, it turns to 6% of the Archdiocese being involved. And like its glorious predecessor, ""All the President's Men"", ""Spotlight"" makes a thriller out of a relatively safe mission without threatening phone calls, death threats, gunshots or chases in dark parking lots.But if the journalists' lives are not at stakes, the harm is already done for the victims' lives, forever ruined as it wasn't just ""physical, but psychological"" abuse, so what the investigation does is a quest for justice and for shining (literally) the spotlight on the people who let some awful crimes to be and let be done. ""What's your responsibility to publish this?"" Mike is asked by a judge, his answer is perfect: ""what's our responsibility not to publish it"". It's a matter of ethics, and as the white knights, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams make an interesting Redford-Hoffman-like pair with Keaton as 'Jason Robards', encouraging the team to go further, or slow down for tactical reasons. Tlming matters as well and it's for these little subtleties, that the screenplay is a winner.""Spotlight"" is one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies, and the Best Picture front-runner, earning a nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Ruffalo was the pounding heart of the film) and for directing and screenplay. Speaking of the screenplay, there's an abundance of name-dropping in the film and that can get pretty confusing, (there's even a moment where they kept referring to Law, and I didn't know it was the name of a Cardinal). But these considerations are trivial because it was the same with ""All the President's Men"" and it wasn't much an issue, as the film is most about the procedural than the details, the big scope: how this team of five journalists will make the light of truth shine. And McCarthy's sober directing, respectful to our intelligence, doesn't overdo the cheers, the last shot alone is emotionally rewarding.For playing in the safe side and for its own good, ""Spotlight"" turns out to be one of the best movies of 2015, and shouldn't be judged for its attack against the Church, but for its fight for the truth, for justice and for the dignity of the victims who were too scared to translate their pain into words. Indeed, it's hard enough to talk about 'sexuality' and religion in public statements, imagine in the same sentence. And it's reassuring that the film was also well-received by the Church which, in a way, is coming to terms with its own demons.",True
89007,17 September 2011,ninispjc,One Day (2011),9.0,"In reading the reviews for this film, it seems to me that most people who strongly disliked this film either didn't really pay attention to it or just didn't get it. One main example being the criticism that Emma loving Dex in the first place never made any sense. Yes, he was a rascal in college, but let's be honest, he's exactly the kind of guy who got all the girls in college. After their ""near miss"" on the day they officially met, they did in fact become friends. He's the only one who helps Emma move, albeit grudgingly. And when she's feeling low about still working in that Mexican restaurant, he's the one who gives her a pep talk and supports her, and we can see he's sincere about what he tells her. When he loses his way and stops being a friend to her is when she breaks off contact with him. In fact, losing her is part of what makes him shape up, even though most of the credit is given to Sylvie. We later see, however, Sylvie is not the saving grace he thought she was.Also, some say there was no chemistry between the leads Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. I suppose this is a subjective thing, but in the beach scene where he rubs sunblock on her back, I could FEEL heat coming off the screen for Pete's sake. Another criticism was Dex was a ""defeated"" man. I didn't see that at all. His television career was a big part of what led him astray. After it was over, he had to reinvent himself, starting from scratch. There's nothing ""defeated"" in a honest day's labor. This could be why Sylvie cheated and left, as she ""married up"" but in the humbleness of working hard to get his feet back on the ground, he did in fact become loving and decent just ***like his mother said*** he would, and by the time he and Emma were ready to plan their wedding, he was owner and operator of his own café, so he did become accomplished as well. He was hardly ""defeated."" I loved the nuances of the story. How Dex's relationship with his parents is never explicitly spelled out in dialogue, but we see how close he is with mom and how distant with dad through his interactions with them. I also loved the use of light to express time of day, how the street lights go out at the beginning, and when the end wraps up the story by returning to the rest of that first day they spend together, the street lights go on as dusk approaches. ***Like Hathaway said***, ""they're talking, and their souls are having a totally different conversation."" That's the loveliness of this movie. Yes, sad things happen, but it ends on a very life-affirming note, as if to say, ""yes, it was worth it. Loving each other breaks their hearts at different times and they think they might not even survive it, but it was worth it."" It truly touches the heart of those who bother to understand what's going on.",True
89201,17 September 2011,StevePulaski,Win Win (2011),8.0,"So many films have been lost in the shuffle this year, and have gone on to be unrecognized and already forgotten gems. The Art of Getting By and Cedar Rapids just to name a few. Win Win was a sleeper hit, even with its great supporting cast, electrifying script, and some of the most surreal filmmaking for a drama in recent memory.Win Win almost reminds me of a possible HBO miniseries condensed into a film. This seems like it could make a decent Television show for a premium cable network. It tells the story of lawyer and part-time wrestling coach named Mike (Giamatti) who is put in charge of caring for an elderly man named Leo (Young). So he doesn't have to do much work at all, Mike puts Leo in a nursing home, but continues to collect the $1,500 check every month for doing work he doesn't do.Mike's wrestling team is pitiful, until he starts caring for Leo's nephew named Kyle (Shaffer), a troubled teen who finds his niche when he begins wrestling for Mike's team. Kyle's homelife is found later to be dreadful, and begins to shake up Mike's simple life as he tries to manage him while care for his loving wife and two kids.The supporting cast of Win Win is pitch-perfect packed with character actors like Bobby Cannavale and Jeffrey Tambor. Every character is played in a non-perfect manor, because the screenplay gives them believable flaws they can't work around. Instead of making them all good human beings, the film gives them baggage that they must work with. It shows the realism behind life, and not the sugarcoated film look we've been getting for quite sometime.There are flaws, sadly. For one, we never know why Mike steals the check every month because we don't know his financial situation. If that could've been elaborated, it would've spawned a whole new breed of conflicts for the film to work on rather than just make Mike look cold-hearted and scummy. Not to mention, some things in the film are symbolic, ***like the boiler room, that are never mentioned*** again and are just the subject of creative screen writing. It doesn't really transfer to film well, and it's never referred back to for future reference.Alex Schaffer reminds me of the real Lucas Cruinkshank, who is famous for the ""FRED"" character on Youtube. He resembles Cruinkshank, and even speaks like him without the pitch effect on his voice. From what I've heard, his hair was bleached for the film to make him look even more troubled and a stand-out. Shaffer is perfect in the film, and probably the strongest point. He wrestles better than he acts, but at least we have a multi-talented child-actor who has developed skills early on. Being this is his first film, and he's already very talented for his age, it can only get better - hopefully.Win Win is seldom, much like Director Thomas McCarthy's previous works. He has a sort of art with the camera, as well as with a pen and paper. He creates real characters, and none of a cliché breed. There are no major twists and turns in the plot, but some caught me off guard surprisingly. Win Win isn't perfect, but it's above-average, which I'll take over cliché and fair any day.Starring: Paul Giamatti, Alex Schaffer, Bobby Cannavale, Jeffrey Tambor, Burt Young, and Amy Ryan. Directed by: Thomas McCarthy.",True

A lot of people were critiquing Mila Kunis's acting in the film and how they found her sexy but yet annoying, well she was really young, ***like 16 or 17 years old I believe she said***,but obviously she is given these roles and well respected as an actress for a reason, and she worked the role to the best of her abilities, yet i digress.. the movie picks up at Patrick Bateman's demise, she was supposed to be being watched by her baby sitter, but was tagged along on a horrific evening on which she was luckily able to survive from, but it was to be expected, to kill the little girl would have been cruel and ended the movie very quickly, especially since that is what are plot is based upon. My problem with the film is only this, I understand she only stayed in college due to the fact that she killed the actual Rachel Newman and had taken her identity, and that she eagerly desired to be an FBI agent to bring justice and prevent things such as what happened to her baby sitter from happening again to anyone else and could only further her chances of achieving that goal by becoming the professor's assistant. My question is, was her character equally demented as Patrick Bateman to top the 1st, because her pursuit overclouded her judgement, and that in itself I suppose answered my own question, but the very reason for killing all of these people defeated her purpose for being there, that's my problem. She was a very smart woman though and made it a very entertaining film to watch, it was given sex appeal with out the sex, she was very good about how she tidied up her messes and how she extracted her kills, yes it may have been less gory, but smart & sexy to say the least, I do not intend to judge upon how attractive she was,cause she is, but it was well acted, but that's just my opinion, watch it again if you must, really dig deep into the plot, do some research on how it was filmed, and let it be judged by that",True

Before you stop reading this review because of that fact, I would like to say that I think that gives me a unique perspective. I was not comparing this movie to the books, I was not expecting specific scenes or events to happen. I had no idea what would happen. I was able to view this movie for what it is, a movie. And after watching this 2 hour masterpiece unfold, I can say with confidence that this was the best movie I have ever seen.I never really had much interest in Harry Potter growing up and ***like I said*** I have never read the books. A few weeks ago I was at my brother's house and he started watching the movies so I thought I would give them a try. The first two were alright, but by the 3rd one they really started getting good. I watched all 7 of them in under 2 weeks. Then we went to the theater to see the final movie and it just blew my mind. I left the theater feeling like I just experienced something that I will never forget. The movie was so powerful, it sent chills down my back like I have never experienced in my life, it nearly had me in tears, and it never failed to completely captivate my attention. There is just something special about the movie, no movie has ever impacted me like this.Some user reviews written by hardcore fans of the book were disappointed in the film. Their disappointment was usually centered around omitted scenes they wanted included, or elements of the film that were different than those of the book. I even read some reviews that claimed this movie was emotionless?!?!? That just seems ridiculous to me. But I wonder if, perhaps, I would of felt the same way had I read the books first. I guess I will never really know. Maybe people who read the books experienced something that I won't fully understand or experience because I will constantly be thinking of the movies and comparing them. But comparison kills contentment. This movie was perfectly paced, powerful, emotional, just completely memorizing. Personally I think if you fail to see it you are comparing it to a book that was probably just as powerful and becoming frustrated in how they are different. But if you can somehow view the movie as separate from the books, which is very difficult if you have already read them, if not impossible, then perhaps you can appreciate it. And I do plan on reading the books, but this experience will live with me forever. Watching the first 7 movies leading up seeing the nearly perfect final movie on the big screen.One final note to the power and emotion of the film. The themes in the movie of self sacrifice, love, and friendship are so powerful and they were portrayed extremely well in the movie.

89573,18 September 2011,Dory_Darko,127 Hours (2010),9.0,"127 Hours depicts the true story of a guy named Aron Ralston, who went canyoneering in Utah in April 2003. Through a pretty serious event of misfortune, he gets trapped in a canyon by a boulder that pulverises his arm against the canyon wall; literally between a rock and a hard place. And, the desperate measures he resorts to in order to free himself. From a Hollywood perspective, this sounds like it could be turned into a wildly spectacular action film with a bold, heroic protagonist, hysterical relatives and ""Where is my son? PLEASE FIND MY SON!!"" *intense sobbing* - type of dialogue. Yes? No. Boy, am I glad this was directed by Danny Boyle... The man we all know for his raw, authentic film style. Instead of aforementioned blockbuster drama, he opted for an incredibly realistic, documentary-like film. 127 Hours starts off with no form of introduction whatsoever. We do not get to 'meet' Aron or any of his relatives. However, any such introduction quickly proves to be redundant as, over the fast-paced opening credits, we see Aron enthusiastically preparing for and taking off on a hiking trip (ignoring his mother's phone call in the process...), and there you have it: this is a 'too cool for school', overconfident adrenaline junkie, and that's all we need to know. This overconfidence gradually proves to be the source of pretty much all his problems, as it is later on revealed that Aron neglected to tell anyone where he was going... Oops.***Like I said***, this film looks and feels very much like a documentary, like National Geographic made a big budget reconstruction of the event. The film makers' choice to cast James Franco was a very good one. He is simply amazing. Mind you – he is alone in this film for about 95% of the time. This requires an actor with the guts and skill to carry an entire film, and I must admit, Franco probably wouldn't have been my first choice. But – to my pleasant surprise – he pulls it off, and is actually very worthy indeed of his Oscar nomination. He displays an impressively wide range of emotions, all equally convincing. Panic, disbelief, despair, delusion, hurt and hallucinations. But even confidence, coolness, exhilaration and rationality; it's all there. Aron Ralston, as a character, starts off as a seemingly quite cocky, confident, care-free dude who just wants to enjoy himself and do what he loves most: exploring nature. Without telling his family. But as the film progresses, and Aron realises just what kind of mess he's in, you can slowly see a change occurring in him. And the fact that, after a while you greatly start to sympathize with him and even admire him, despite his obvious stupidity before, is all due to James Franco. He has really proved himself to be a very fine character actor with the capability of moving his audience. There is one scene in particular which I found really captivating. During the 'Tuesday' scene, Aron records himself on his camcorder, acting like he's on a talk show, answering his own questions. This scene is top-notch, acting wise, and this is where you really start to feel for him. Throughout Aron's ordeal, we are shown various flashbacks of his childhood, friends, family and loves. This might seem ***like a cliché, but honestly, what else are you supposed to think about when you're stuck in a canyon for five days? Some people on the boards and in other reviews have said*** they think Aron to be a superficial person for not having some kind of spiritual enlightenment while he was trapped, but I just want to voice my own personal opinion on that matter. Honestly, I don't think it's anybody's business to judge what Aron thought and felt throughout his ordeal. We all deal with hardship in our own personal way, and talking to God is not necessarily an option for everyone. Some of us simply draw support from family and love and good memories. I know that's what I'd do. Now, back to technical talk. The sense of realism of 127 Hours comes greatly from the grainy, unsteady camera work and graphic depiction of everything. Which is a note that comes with a warning: this film is not for the faint of heart. What surprised me is that the scene where Aron 'releases' himself is visually very graphic. I won't go into detail, but you really shouldn't watch this if you don't have the stomach.There were only a few minor things which bothered me during this film. It has a few moments which, inevitably are a bit boring. But then again, even that seems to fit into the story, so perhaps it makes sense. And I personally think the music wasn't always very well chosen, some of it didn't really fit somehow. But none of this is really any bother.127 Hours may not be as profound as Into the Wild, but it's certainly a very well-crafted film which deserves respect on its own merits. Also, the photography of the film is really beautiful and some of the scenery of the canyons is truly breathtaking. I would recommend it for the pretty pictures alone. Anyhow, if you're interested in a really good episode of ""I shouldn't be alive"", this is the film for you.",True
89657,18 September 2011,MartinHafer,Sadie Thompson (1928),8.0,"Unfortunately, the final reel of ""Sadie Thompson"" has been partially lost due to the ravages of time on nitrate stock. Because of this, the final portion often uses stills to fill in the blanks. It's a less than desirable way to do the film, but there simply is no other choice unless a final reel is one day discovered and the film is pieced back together. In addition, some other portions of the film are pretty rough, but not so much that it seriously impacts watching the film.I have already seen this story two other times, though this is the first time I've seen the silent version. While it's obvious that Gloria Swanson plays a prostitute (Sadie Thompson), ***like other films of the day, it's strongly implied but they never called her that or said*** exactly what she was--just that she was a woman of 'ill-repute' or was 'undesirable'. But, unless you are really, really young or really, really naive, it's very clear what the film is implying in this adaptation of the W. Somerset Maugham story.The story begins with Sadie arriving on the island of Pago-Pago. On board the ship are also some moralistic reformers, the Davidsons (Lionel Barrymore and Blanche Friderici). Unfortunately for Sadie, these reformers seem to spend almost every waking moment worrying about Sadie's sex life and work hard to have her thrown off the island. At first, Sadie is contemptuous of them but later when it looks like they are about to become successful, things change very quickly. Where all this ends up you'll need to see for yourself.I liked the acting of this film--especially Swanson's. It was rather bawdy yet very restrained (except for when it called for lots of emotion near the end)--and it easily could have been over the top. Also, although the film's in rough shape, what you do see is quite good--with a good reproduction of the tropical locale and nice camera-work. All in all, a very high quality film from start to finish. Too bad about the missing footage.By the way, Sadie's ruggedly handsome love interest, Sgt. O'Hara, is played by the film's director, Raoul Walsh! He actually gave up acting for directing full-time after he lost an eye in an accident--shortly after completing this film.",True

92195,3 October 2019,sweidman-28016,星際救援 (2019),8.0,"Ad Astra Review:Astronaut Roy McBride undertakes a mission across an unforgiving solar system to uncover the truth about his missing father and his doomed expedition that now, 30 years later, threatens the universe in James Gray's new film Ad Astra. Going into the film I didn't know much about it. From the trailer that I watched it looked somewhat like Interstellar, which happens to be one of my all time favorite films. What I got out of it was not what I expected too much of, and I'm happy with what it provided. Here's the thing people need to know when going into Ad Astra: this is not just a space movie. If you're anything like me you like a good philosophical film disguised as something else. This is exactly what it is but different. Ad Astra explores the themes of father and son, science, life, and fears. I won't do a full on analysis since I don't like to spoil much. Let's start with the acting. Many people are going to criticize Brad Pitt for his acting. His character is mellow and monotone but that's part of who he is. I enjoyed his performance a lot. It sort of reminded me of Ryan Gosling in First Man (an underrated film by audiences in my opinion). Just because a character is mellow doesn't mean they're bad at acting (in most cases). It's their character and they're doing it the way it's written. Also a good majority of the film is voice over from within Roy's mind. Voice over is kind of a cheap tactic in my opinion but they did it justice somehow in this. His thoughts are real and philosophical making the audience reflect on situations and actual life. His relationship of trying to find and figure out his father (Tommy Lee Jones) was interesting to me. There wasn't a strong relationship but it grows and grows over time as he's exploring. I think Jones did a fine job and along with Donald Sutherland with the time they're in it. The acting is nothing award worthy but I'll point out that it's good. Now to the screenplay. The story is really good. I'm kind of explaining it as I go on in this review. Overall the plot is interesting and explores many topics. This is a slow burner so if you don't like that this is going to be painful for you. Also I don't think of this much as an action movie. The action scenes are different an unique. It's nothing big and in your face but more realistic. The best one takes place on the moon and the sounds of explosions and shots aren't really in your face and sound more subtle, like the sound is being drowned out from the helmets. ***Like I said*** it's nothing super intense but the tension and stakes are there. I should add that I think this film should win Best Visual Effects this year. They're so realistic and nothing looked fake. There's something about space movies that can just do it right where everything looks realistic. This brings me back to First Man winning that award this past Academy Awards show. It's realistic and nothing super in your face. At the beginning there's a scene (all these scenes I'm talking about have been in the trailer just to let you know) where he climbs out of their space station and there's a shot of him going down, Earth right below him. The detail was stunning and I really wish I could have seen it in IMAX. The cinematography along with the visuals was always a beauty to look at. Hoyte Van Hoytema also did the cinematography for Interstellar (which should've been nominated) and I think he's even better from that. Hopefully this film will earn another nomination with that. Back to the story, as the journey continues the story goes deeper and more interesting. I will admit there are some slow spots and also an unnecessary minimal plot line with his wife. It didn't add much to the story in my opinion and could've gone without or at least not come back to as often as it does. Scenes are just burned into my head of all different sorts. Some scenes are pretty violent but in a unique way that I liked. The audience doesn't see much of the violence but the little is just enough. This is a film to remember. Another thing I should add before finishing this review is the score. Wow does this have an amazing score by Max Richter. It's such a shame that he's only released one song, To The Stars, for us to listen to. Sort of like the tactic made by Arcade Fire when they composed their Oscar nominated score for Her, except Max Richter actually released a song. The score isn't over bearing and in your face. It's just the right volume and not over the top. I put it in my own genre of scores that make me reflect on everything. There's no other way I can describe it but that. I'd highly recommend Ad Astra. It's not for everyone so be warned if you don't want to think.My Grade: A-",True

92776,3 October 2019,LloydBayer,小丑 (2019),9.0,"Forget the title. Abandon everything you know about the Joker character from the Batman movies and DC Comics source material. Forget the previous screen iterations of the Joker. For just a moment, and I'll dare say, forget about the most popular and beloved version from Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. Don't even think or expect this to be a superhero movie. There are no fancy latex costumes and certainly no studio powered CGI. Made from a frugal budget and running at a healthy 120 minutes, this film doesn't promise anything you would expect in a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't ask for anything in return either. But right from the very first minute, you will be smitten, because this is essentially a story about Arthur Fleck, and not really about the Joker as we've seen before.Never heard that name before? Don't worry, no one else has. That's because almost everything about this film is fresh and reimagined; but also masked with layers of familiarity. I'm referring to a very cinematic late 1970s New York City with a distinctive Martin Scorsese vibe. And although several scenes seem to say we are watching the story unfold in Gotham City, what we see is the naked soul of New York and not DC Comics' mirror image of the former. With this comes chaos and panic in flawed, fractured, vile and unsympathetic people. Arthur Fleck doesn't believe he is one of these people. He cares for his ageing mother while trying to make ends meet as a rent-a-clown. He has dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and an encounter with TV talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) might give him half a chance at success. But no one ever said life is fair, right? Between dealing with a neurological disorder that causes uncontrollable bursts of laughter and retreating from the pain of everyday life, Arthur has to cope with being an outcast, a loner, a looser, a misunderstood bystander desperate to be accepted. If this weren't bad enough, his mother reveals a family secret that becomes a catalyst and turning point in the story.What follows is a two-pronged approach into dissecting what Arthur is becoming, while simultaneously implying why he must pursue who his father is. The answer and consequences of finding the truth is an eye-popping moment because the subject is just boldly imaginative and equally subversive to everything we think we know about the character. Which to its credit, makes this film a head-smacking original. And while the Joker is much more than an origins story, this is a film made with a lot of creative freedom, which is clearly visible in the character arc of Arthur Fleck. That means very little or no studio arm twisting to rope in the cash cow. You could say director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix as the titular character have not only reimagined the Joker from an iconic villain to devastating vigilante, they have rewritten events and characters from DC Comics into Arthur's world. In doing so, they have written and published a cinematic language that was once lost, forgotten, eroded by the cash flow that came from tentpole Hollywood blockbusters, that ironically, includes superhero films to blame.While the story is linear and simple to follow, it does everything but give you easy answers. What the film is really aiming at is the moral and mental conflict, and physical and psychological transformation of an ordinary man into a pathological killer. As this person, Joaquin Phoenix is incredibly and immensely watchable, going from childlike innocence to someone capable of unimaginable terror. Equally astonishing is his actual transformation into a sort of contortionist with a unique cackle that sounds like a crow on concentrated caffeine. You can't take your eyes off him, and while you are subconsciously aware Arthur is a work of fiction, at no point will you have the time to compare Phoenix to other actors who played the Joker. Another interesting inclusion is De Niro, who at first appears to be in a cameo role. But there is more to his inclusion than it seems. Outside throwing back to similarly introverted roles in Taxi Driver (1976) and Raging Bull (1980), as the aforementioned Scorsese psychological dramas set in New York, De Niro also has a key role in molding Arthur. You may see it coming but when it happens, it's a shocker and in itself worthy of a second viewing.Dark, gritty, and at times unsettling, this is Joaquin Phoenix ***like never before, and the same can be said*** about the new Joker; but also hauntingly beautiful and an impressive cinematic achievement. Unconcerned with any or all previous versions of the titular character, Joker will leave you with an overwhelming sense of empathy for a person just trying to fit in. If you don't see it that way, the joke's on you.",True
93036,9 July 2020,sdav27,The Last of Us: Part II (2020 Video Game),9.0,"This review for The Last of Us Part II will contain spoilers. This is Naughty Dog's most ambitious game yet and it shows. I'll start with what I loved about the game. The graphics are absolutely incredible, the best I've seen this generation. The attention to detail is absolutely astounding. There are little to no glitches. The environments and level design are excellent. It is a beautiful world to be in.The gameplay is my favorite part of the game and what ultimately saves the game for me. New mechanics and new infected types help to keep the gameplay fresh from the first game. The gameplay in Part II is basically a more refined version of the original. Going prone gives the game more verticality. Dodging enemy attacks was quite useful most of the time even though I found it to be a bit finicky at times. The crafting system and upgrade systems for skills and weapons is more intricate this time around. However, one issue I had with the skills upgrades was that you had to upgrade skills within the same branch in order of how they are presented in the skill tree. Bricks and bottles return. However, one minor nitpick I had was that if you have a brick in your inventory, you could not pick a bottle and vice versa. This was not the case in the original, as you could pick up either a brick or bottle at any time. These minor gripes aside, the gameplay is spectacular and quite intense. The acting in this game is some of the best I've seen in any game.The cast brings their A-game, especially Ashley Johnson, Troy Baker, and Laura Bailey. The music score by Gustavo Santaolalla is fantastic yet again and one of the best parts of the game without a doubt.My major issues with the game lies in the narrative and characters. While the story is deep and complex, there are some problems with it. My main issue is the circumstances surrounding Joel's death. Now, I don't have an issue with Joel dying, as it serves the narrative for the story that Neil Druckmann and Naughty Dog wanted to tell. Although, Joel's death would not have been the catalyst for the story if I was writing it, but I will get to that later. Abby finding Joel seemed way too coincidental to me and feels very forced. I wish they could have found a more natural way for it to happen. Additionally, although Neil says otherwise, I do not think Joel and Tommy would trust a group of strangers even if they are not the same men from Part I. Even if Joel is softer than he was in Part I, certainly red flags would go off if he sees a big group of armed people so close to Jackson. I am also unsure why Tommy would reveal his and Joel's names as well as where Jackson is to a group of strangers. This just doesn't fit their characters in my opinion. It seems like the writers didn't know how else they could kill Joel and just settled on this. Again, I would not mind Joel's death if it did not feel so unnatural.The side characters in Ellie's story are great, particularly Dina and Jesse, but they do not get enough time to fully develop. The flashbacks with Joel and Ellie are excellent. Ellie's birthday flashback is the giraffe scene of this game. The flashbacks give great insight to their relationship, however I can't help but feel this should have been part of the main storyline. This is why I feel that Joel's death in the first two hours was a bit of waste in my eyes. There's so much that they could have done with Joel and Ellie's relationship, and it was not fully realized within the final product.Next is Abby's character. I really hated playing as her at first, but I really did come to like her. My issue with her story is that her supporting characters are, for the most part, not memorable and unlikable. However, Yara and Lev were exceptions to this. Abby and Lev's relationship really reminded me of Joel and Ellie's relationship. In fact, Ellie's and Abby's stories contradict one another. Ellie's story is a straightforward tale of revenge and Abby's story is a complex tale of redemption. Joel's story in Part I was also one of redemption. Abby also plays a lot like Joel with her stealth kills and she also uses shivs. I really like how these parallels are presented. It seems as though Abby was given better weapons and set pieces compared to Ellie, probably as a way to convince the player to like Abby more.Now that I have had time to let it marinate, I have come to appreciate the ending more. Ellie finally came to the realization that killing Abby would not bring Joel back and let her live, therefore ending the cycle of violence once and for all. My interpretation is that since Ellie can no longer play the guitar because of her missing fingers, she leaves it behind along with her memory of Joel. It seems that she is now at peace. She has forgiven Abby for killing Joel and she has forgiven Joel for taking away her chance for her life to mean something. I am not sure where Ellie is heading, possibly back to Jackson or somewhere else entirely. ***Like I said***, the story is one that is deep and emotionally draining, but it has plot holes and pacing issues. I already went over the plot holes. Even though I love Ellie's flashbacks, her and Abby's flashbacks really mess with the pacing and take away from the main storyline. Abby's section of the game also feels like it goes for too long. In fact, the game in general feels overlong. There were many times that, as I was getting to the end, I said, ""when is this over?"" This was the first Naughty Dog game I have played that I found myself saying this.It may seem like I am being very critical. That's because I hold the original The Last of Us very dear to me. It was one of the most special experiences I ever had playing the game, so the sequel had a lot to live up to. Waiting for a game for so long made it impossible to live up to my expectations. With that said, Part II's story took balls to tell and I give Naughty Dog a lot of credit for not going the safe route, even though I think that would have been better. The Last of Us Part II is still a great game that is extremely well made. The gameplay is really what saves this game for me. At this point in time, I give the game an 8/10 rating.",True

93448,9 July 2020,dianajmilton,Eksmisja (2012),3.0,"I am unsure whether I fully agree with the message that the movie, the author, who has personal attachment to the characters as well as the place portrayed tries to get across. The old couple living in this apartment for 60 years; of course they are old and it is difficult for them to change the place of their living. However, at the same time, we have to accept some responsibilities for our lives and to live in a rented apartment without ownership and not ensuring in owns younger years that we have a permanent place to live, is accepting the risk that one day, we will have to move out because we don't own this place. I don't think it sounds harsh, it is just the reality of the contract, situation we entered into.
With that, I also found that the author tries to use some 'half-truths' or stretching some statements to confirm his narrative. E.g. the older lady talks about some illnesses that the situation made worse for her but again, without trying to sound too harsh, they don't sound too extreme. The interviews with the lawyers are cut off at certain points and it is never stated that the actual law is broken or the owner of the apartment persistently harassed the older couple (which of course I would never wish on them); it is just presented that the mysterious owner is impossible to reach. The couple talks about their childhood experiences from the times of World War II. There is a mention of not too glorious behaviors from Austrian people at a time. It is only a 30 second clip in the film and I feel it was inserted there with some particular agenda as it stands out like that, a short mention for no reason. The couple also makes some remarks about communist and socialist times in Poland but I feel that it is all said in the context so as to justify their expectation and hurt of their current situation that they have to move out. I believe that by the time that this happens to them, they would have lived in a capitalism reality for the better part of 20 years. They should have adjusted their thinking and life decisions to these circumstances, where e.g. private ownership becomes more prevalent and protected.
Overall I feel there was nothing extreme about the situation, in fact, the couple was quite unusual in that they lived there and never moved for such a long time. Certainly they deserved to be treated with kindness and understanding but at the same time they should have been aware that they lived in a capitalism reality in a rented, not owned apartment. ***Like the lady said***, there are and were much more worse situations brought on people, even going back to the times of World War II where thousands of people were re-settled not within one town to a different apartment but rather to Siberia or another country and thrown out to bare ground to sort themselves out. FOr that reason, I don't like the English translation of the Polish title 'Eksmisja'. It is translated as 'Resettlement' while it should have really been 'Eviction' or actually 'Notice to move out' because the couple were never evicted.
Overall, I feel that the author lacks the diligence in telling the story, unpeeling and presenting the facts while at the same time making some statements and showing some images (e.g newspaper cuttings of articles about landlords which are just general news not articles about the couple from the film) to justify the narrative he wanted to convey.",True
93554,10 July 2020,monkyron,Finale (I) (2018),3.0,"The first hour is just plain boring. All of the suspense is lost when the film spoilers itself by changing back and forth between the gas station which is the main first half and the torture place (the main second half). Then there are a lot of things that do not make sense, for example that no one manages to call the police despite it being obviously necessary. And when the police would finally receive a call.... our annoying ""protagonist"" and the other two get kidnapped and we do not even see how. The good things are the last 30 minutes (with some kind of interesting story and a bit suspense) and the cinematography of the whole film.
Throughout the film there is a wannabe deep theme of what the limits of entertainment are. It feels like the director saw a Lars Von Trier movie and thought ""I want that too"" but didnt know how to adress a more interesting theme or do it in a more detailed and interesting way. He just scratches the surface of a theme that doesn't even feel unique at all. ""Funny Games"" had the same theme of ""what are the limits of entertainment?"" used it better AND even criticizes it with confidence instead of beeing too obvious! The obviousness of this theme in ""Finale"" feels ***like a excuse for its gore even tho the gore isn't even that harsh (""What, I'm violent? But I'm artsy too! That means I am more than just a wannabe gory horror-thriller!"")
As said***, the gore wasn't even that good - except the nipple scene! That one was well made and uncomfortable to watch! The rest doesn't look real enough and at times happens way too fast for you to empathize (for example when one man looses his legs because he's pulled apart in an instant).",True

You don't have to connect it to the real world or fictional world for explanation & back story. It's just quick & episodic, and there's no time to fit a lot in. So suspend all your disbeliefs & try to enjoy. That being said, this is one of the best episodes of The Twilight Zone, with an unique concept. Not everything can be about aliens or apocalypse, time travel or shocking plot twists.Now for the person making claims that the given story doesn't make any sense, why did he have to mess up with the woman, & all the silly questions. Let me tell you if you couldn't figure it out. This man had probably studied about the dead people he was impersonating, or might've known them somehow indirectly, or even killed them himself & made it look like an accident so he could take advantage of them; honestly it doesn't matter. Sure he could've done something easy, but that wouldn't have been a compelling drama for an episode. So deal with it.What he wanted was some money that could sustain him for life or a really long time, and a woman that loved him with her life. That's why he seduced the woman by impersonating her lover, and then he impersonated a gangster who was owed a lot of money, & collected his amount. If it wasn't for the turn of events, he was planning to run away with her to Chicago or somewhere else with the acquired money. That's why he was packing his suitcase, as he was planning to meet her at the station ***like he said***. He would've had the money, & the woman who truly loved him.He was a twisted crook & just wanted to have some fun. Given his age, this could be one of his many little missions, just the most dangerous one yet; and he could always just abandon her later & move on to another mission for fun. He could be doing it for the thrills.A lot of people misuse their gifts, this is prevalent among a lot classic comic books villains or heroes who turn villains in an alternate universe, there's nothing surprising about it. For all we know, he could be a mutant living on Earth 616 or something & people are not aware of them yet, just like it was in X-Men in the beginning. Nobody mentioned that this was set on our Earth. What would you do if you had the power of invisibility, would completely depend on your nature & personality.Most of this was pretty much clear from the dialogues, & you certainly didn't pay any attention & missed it. Nothing was meaningless here, it was far too obvious & a lot of potential conclusions can be drawn from it. This simple episode is truly misunderstood if I go by other reviews, but I don't know why. This sort of imaginative piece deserves better, especially when you know about the time it actually came out. Don't give in to the Seinfeld effect, if that's the reason you didn't like this episode instead, because that's just unfortunate & not the episode's fault.",True

94250,14 September 2013,Reno-Rangan,3096 Tage (2013),8.0,"The movie based on the true story of Austrian woman Natascha Kampusch. At the age of ten she was abducted by an unemployed young man called Wolfgang Priklopil and kept her in a secret cellar for the 8 long years. Warning, this movie is not suitable for everyone because the movie had many disturbing, nude scenes. It was harsh true but raw for a movie and I am happy they made this.It's easy to find the errors on the technical aspect and the flaws of the movie but when you think of it from the girl's perspective it is totally shocking and long incident that everyone never dreamt about. So there's no point in pointing the mistakes because you are not watching it for an entertaining but to know the bitter truth, right? Natascha Kampusch was a normal young Austrian girl, she did not try any heroic endeavoring during her captivity but her bravery attempt at the end of the movie made her free from the slavery. As you see the title you will come to know almost everything about the movie even the end twist as well not complicated as one you think but when you watch the movie it tells the way it really happened.As a kidnapper, Wolfgang Priklopil was a smarter and sharper enough. He read the girl's character and behaviour perfectly, he tried to give her freedom within the border he marked and also tortured her to make believe she's in his command. But his overconfident led him to the disaster from his perspective. In the end, good always wins over evil.Antonia Campbell-Hughes was excellent as Natascha Kampusch and so the little version of her. I heard that she lost lots of weight for the role, I guess it's her best performance till now from those I have seen.Remember you won't watch it for enjoy the moment, it was those movies like 'Trade' and 'Garden of the Night' that will remind you about the real pervert co-existed in our society. As per me it is a must see movie but you should keep it in your mind ***like I said*** it was a little disturbing for its adult contents.8/10",True

Great ideas, poor execution. I want to point out that this is my first review, so bare with me. This show is just so bad, and there are so very little negative reviews, that I feel I have to warn the public. The script is bad, the acting is over exaggerated, and the fake laughter is EVERYWHERE. The Melissa character, as well as the Joey character needs to be toned down. To much makeup, unnatural lines and just to much everything. It doesn't feel natural, any of it. I feel like the actors are over exaggerating their lines so that it can seem funny. Which just makes this show all the more unwatchable. And the writing is just bad, I sometimes felt embarrassed for the actors that they had to say those things. I just wanted it to stop. And ***like I said***, I really tried, 20 episodes tried.

I'm a clashing of the swords type of fan anyway so with that on my side I found myself kind of sucked in by the characters. I enjoyed them very much. Admittedly, the plot was of the weaker variety but the characters sold this one for me straight from minute one. The outdoor scenes showing off the wet, cloudy misty forest of the UK could have been a little better. They made sure to show the rugged landscape but, missed an opportunity to do a better job. I'm not from the UK and understood the film maker's attempt. I don't know what it lacked, but it lacked something! It gave the movie a B type quality for me personally. Thank goodness for the the good actors!There just weren't enough horses, rattling of chains, boiled leather or viking boats. One of the guys actually spoke Welsh ***according to another reviewer***. That was cool. I hadn't heard that before. The main character never reached any sort of hero status and that was fine with me. Everyone can''t come to the rescue of every danged damsel in distress or family member for that matter. If they had just thrown in a few more horses snorting in the cold misty air, more creaking wooden boats, better viking camps scenes and maybe filmed on at least one sunny day I would have given it another point. Of course all of this is totally my own stinky, personal opinion!I'm sure that the Hammer of the Gods is not for the more refined and cultured movie palates but, for the weekend 'reclinerholics' like me, kicking back with a few suds, it kept me entertained.",True

94906,15 September 2013,zabokrugby8,The Motorcycle Diaries (2004),10.0,"First, had to set aside my prejudices to view this film. If you're ***like me whenever 'Ernesto Che Guevera' is even mentioned*** en passant, I found myself conflicted. Yes, I too have many preconceived notions as to who the 'real' Che was. But from the film adaptation of the novel by Guevera's own hand, we learn that Ernesto started out in earnest (scuza the pun): Guevera studied to become a doctor. Quite the noble calling. And far flung from his later political activist career where his life was cut short: he died in a hail of bullets; called for by his Bolivian captors and eventual executioners.Let me set that all aside for now. Ernesto or 'Fuser' as he was affectionately known to his side kick and co-adventurer, Alberto, who is slightly older but still in his twenties plans the adventure of a lifetime. Together the 20 year-old idealists riding two up in the saddle atop an oil bleeding but still functioning single cylinder 500 cc Norton affectionately named 'The Mighty One' set out. They envision seeing and experiencing the length and a good part of the breadth of the South American continent.The intrepid explorers begin their journey in their native Argentina. From Buenos Aires, they ride south. Then they plan to head north: hug the Pacific coast and follow the roads all the way up from the tip of Chile. Their destination: Venezuela. Once they reached Caracas, Fuser and Alberto would celebrate the latter's 30th birthday. The entire journey was to take no more than six months.En route, the explorers experience everything from the forever changing landscapes such as the towering Chilean Andes to the gamut of human emotions. Even at their tender age, I doubt if the lads were prepared or even welcomed their encounters with fellow 'average' Latin Americans. Especially poignant is their visit to a Leper Colony. Fuser is moved from the very first encounter. Moreover, he cannot hide his indignation at the suffering of the sick but also for the oppressed peoples that they encounter throughout. Alberto, on the other hand, is all too consumed with his amorous side of the adventure. For certain, he is not one to morph into a deep thinker. Not if a loose skirt or unbuttoned female tunic beckons nearby.Late in the film, Alberto though does have his epiphany; sort of. In Venezuela,the two pals who were almost inseparable but at times insufferable; part ways. Fuser now filled to the brim with memories of the social injustices he's experienced everywhere on the continent is resolute: he vows to change the world. Or at least the Latin American contingent. Alberto,not of the same persuasion, disavows himself from that laudable platitude. But not before the two exchange tear filled hugs. Then Alberto returns to Venezuela. Fuser doesn't join him; he sets his sights farther afield: Cuba.Throughout this film, I was drawn to their journey. Many times I felt transported to each scene: I was right there, alongside the two Latin musketeers. And along with the ethos and pathos themes there was plenty of humor to draw from as well: such as their harrowing escape from the local dance hall after Fuser tried to romance the drunken mechanic's wife. The benevolent tradesman who just hours earlier had offered to repair the 'tired' Norton for free, sobered up just in time: a friend caught the two tryst makers escaping into the Chilean night air; almost certain they would christen their chance meeting.Both director Walter Salles and producer Robert Redford deserve many kudos for making this stirring and moving film. Despite what your views now are on how Ernesto Che Guevera turned out later, if you're like me, theFuser character as portrayed brilliantly in the film by Gael Garcia Bernal is one to emulate at any age. To wit, it's never too late to show compassion on those that society has forgotten. Makes no difference where you live either. Or what your political affiliations are. How can we remain silent when so much injustice still abounds in the world? I remember Fuser saying the exact same line. Many times; still needs to be said even more.Good on all those who helped make this film a reality. Because the reality is this: much social injustice exists around the globe even today; still seems to be a topic that is to be avoided at all costs; especially by the 'haves'.

95157,26 December 2008,hitchcockthelegend,The Wizard of Oz (1939),10.0,"Dorothy is a young girl living on a Kansas farm, during a tornado, she, along with her dog Toto, is swept up and plonked down in a magical and mysterious land known as Oz. Desperate to get back home and under threat from a wicked witch, she is advised to seek out a great wizard who should be able to help her get back home. As she sets off and on her way, she meets and befriends a wonderful array of characters whom also have something to ask of the fabled wizard. It's a journey that will prove to be both magical and fraught with danger.The Wizard Of Oz is a film that has been pored over and dissected from almost everyone involved in the wonderful world of film. One thing that strikes me every time I view it is that there not only is no place ***like home, there is also no film like The Wizard Of Oz, and really, when all is said*** and done, there is unlikely to be another film of its ilk to ever grace the silver screen. Upon multiple viewings only the most biased of film fan could say that it is a technically perfect picture, it clearly isn't, for at times it's a wee bit creaky and when scrutinised, some of the performances in the piece are far from being of an excellent standard. Crucially, though, any misgivings are quickly erased due to the utter wonder of it all, you see this is because the film has a beguiling ability to transport everybody who is watching it and slot them into OZ alongside Dorothy.The Wizard Of Oz appeals (and caters) to every demographic and pretty much any age group, we have adventure, the meeting of new friends, fears and trepidations, booming colour, songs to singalong with, and of course the total crux point of homely values. The Wizard Of Oz stands up well 80 years later because it taps into all the emotions available to the human being. Be it a young child spellbound on a first viewing, or an octogenarian couple of grandparents wistfully humming along to the tunes, it's a film that shouldn't be dissected looking for faults and hidden meanings, it's a film that should be loved and praised for the ode to fantastical whimsy that it so obviously is.The film of course will forever be associated with its darling star, Judy Garland. Viewing now, and knowing what a sad life she would eventually lead, The Wizard Of Oz is a fitting picture on which to remember what a magical and wonderful performer she was. Myself as a lump of waning middle aged machismo, has no shame in saying that as Judy sings Somewhere Over The Rainbow I melt and feel as though I'm being sent spinning into another world, that's the power of the piece, because as a sepia Kansas becomes the glorious colour of Oz, nothing else in my world matters, I'm in hook line and sinker.There are many interesting back stories to the picture, with books galore available to anyone interested. Some notes that might interest you being the original castings to be W.C. Fields, Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin, munchkins running riot, drunken cast members, sadness and suicides, and grizzled old pros fighting hard not to let Garland steal the picture. Well it makes for a great read, for sure, but what remains to this day is one of the most beloved pictures to have ever been made, for once in the pantheon of great cinema we have a film that is termed a classic, that actually deserves to have that tag!One of the great things about the advent of technology is that it can benefit old classic movies to make them better, for now we can view remastered editions of The Wizard Of Oz and appreciate even more what a great job the makers did. Keep your eyes on Dorothy's Ruby Slippers during the film and see how they are the sparkling important character that they should be, or take in the brilliant work of the make up crew, the tiniest of rivets on The Tin Man a testament to the brilliant work that goes into bringing magic to our lives. Get the newest copy you can and then also see it on the biggest screen available to you because The Wizard Of Oz is a 10/10 movie. And then some.",True
95164,26 December 2008,madbandit20002000,The Spirit (2008),9.0,"Movies based on comic book characters have invaded theaters like a fleet of ships nowadays. The main protagonists of the four-color opuses either have super powers and/or cool gadgets. The title hero of the quirky, over-the-top but romantic ""The Spirit"", has none, but that's doesn't make him uninteresting, especially in the surprisingly competent, script/directorial hands of Frank Miller, the Sam Peckinpah of the comic book industry.Based on the 1940s comic strip created by the late Will Eisner, the master of sequential illustration and an influence/friend of Mr. Miller's, Central City cop Denny Colt (adept, GQ model-like Gabriel Macht) is killed in action. He doesn't stay dead for long when he leaves his grave and offers his death-cheating advantage, by being a ""super cop"", to top magistrate Dolan (""The Wonder Years"" alum Dan Lauria). The reason of this resurrection isn't so good; Colt's the guinea pig of egomaniacal mobster The Octopus (Oscar nominee Samuel L. Jackson, who's a ball of fun here), who's also immortal, but wants bona fide, magical immortality by getting a vase containing the blood of demi-god Hercules. A screw up occurs, involving international jewel thief/black widow assassin Sand Saref (sexy Eva Mendes of ""Training Day""), an old childhood girlfriend of Colt's. Guns are drawn; knives are thrown and sexual pheromones creep in the cold air of the metropolis.If you find this film a Batman rip-off, you're so laughable to feel that way ( Eisner went to Dewitt Clinton High School, Bronx, NY with Batman framer Bob Kane) and if you think Mr. Miller should stick to comic books, you're certifiable (He could balance both film and comic books, if need be).After co-directing the cine-translation of own crime saga, ""Sin City"" with Robert Rodriguez (the Spy Kids and El Mariachi sagas; ""Planet Terror"") and producing the adaptation of his take of the Thermopylae battle, ""300"" by Zack Snyder (""Watchmen""), Miller proves to be up to the task of helming a film featuring a mentor's signature character, whose own obscurity is enough to reason why Mr. Miller handled the film. I ask hard-core fanboys who demean Miller's treatment: who else could have direct it? Spielberg? Santa Claus? The Easter Bunny? The Tooth Fairy? Martians? Sure, there's the over-the top moments where Jackson's dressed as a samurai and a Nazi, and when Jackson clobbers Macht with a toilet (!), but if you've read Miller's work, you know what to expect: darkness mixed with madcap humor. If you don't, this is a fantasy world. Accept it or don't.Miller uses what he's learned from Rodriquez here and uses it well. The mix-match of cornball movie dialogue (Miller's a film noir fan, as long as a lover of the Warner Bros's animated Looney Tunes shorts), vintage fashion and modern technology playfully echoes ""Batman: The Aninated Series"", and the use of digital background and minimal sets gives the film an avant-garde, stage play atmosphere.Game are the actors. A second fiddle in films ***like ""Behind Enemy Lines"" and ""Because I Said*** So"", Mr. Macht resurrects the late Cary Grant and Chris Reeve (the latter watched the former in ""Bringing Up Baby"" in order to play Clark Kent in the ""Superman"" films, and Mr. Eisner used the former as a model to create his hero) with his valiant yet skirt-chasing persona while Jackson, a Miller fan, redeems his absence from ""Sin City"" by matching dire villainy with Macht's classic heroism.Like Denny, it's hard to choose a favorite among the ladies: vixen Saref (Ms. Mendes should play assassin Mariah, if ""Sin City: Hell and Back"" is cine-adapted); the Octopus's brainy, sexy gun moll Silken Floss (Woody Allen stable actress Scarlett Johansson); Dolan's daughter/Florence Nightingale doc Ellen (Sarah Paulson of ""Studio 60"" and ""The Notorious Bettie Page""), chipper rookie cop Morgenstern (Stana Katic of the crime drama TV series ""Castle""); dancing torturer Plaster of Paris (Paz Vega of ""Spanglish"") or death goddess Lorelei (""City"" alum Jamie King). It's a harem, people! Mr. Lauria's bulldog, Ernest Borgnine-like demeanor is tough, familiar and likable while Louis Lombardi (""24"") is a hoot as multiple ""Smiley Goon"" clones the Octopus mass produces. They probably share borderline Down's Syndrome, along with looks.Mr. Miller makes a cameo as a cop who gets decapitated, his fourth ""cine-death"". First blown up in a drug lab in ""Robocop 2"" (which Miller co-penned and later demeaned), then cerebrally knifed by Bullseye in the film version of ""Daredevil"" (which he reinvigorated), next shot by Marv in ""City"" and now thisI should say, ""Oh my God! They killed Frank Miller! You bastards!"" Look out for comic book historical references.What's also interesting is the exclusion of the Spirit's sidekick, young cabbie Ebony White. According to Miller, he didn't want to put a child in an adult world. I figured he didn't know how to modernize a racially stereotypical character, which Mr. Eisner later apologized for creating, and that's probably for the best.In a recent Q and A, Miller joked if Eisner, who died in 2005, knew he was the Spirit's custodian, he would have beaten him up. If I were Eisner, I'd give Miller a big hug for making a shamelessly fun film, better than the cheesy ""Sheena"", based on another character co- created by him (with Jerry Iger). Eisner was wise to not have his name attached to it, but if he were alive, he wouldn't mind being name-attached to ""The Spirit"". It's in reliable hands.",True

Considering that it was made by Larry Buchanan, it's no surprise that the film not only stinks but is rather boring. This is the same guy who managed to make MARS NEEDS WOMEN dull--and which a title ***like this, how could you possibly make it dull?! This is the same director who is seldom mentioned*** in the pantheon of bad directors but should--producing films that even Ed Wood would be ashamed of making!! The film begins just after a worldwide nuclear war. Practically everyone is dead but a small oasis of life exists all thanks to an explanation that really never made any sense. But, the old guy who explains it all seems to know what he's talking about, as he's got provisions and plans on surviving along with his daughter. However, several survivors straggle in as well as there just isn't enough food for them all AND a couple of the survivors are obvious scum--so obvious that you wonder why anyone would bother to save them! Well, with the help of one of the 'nice' survivors (Paul Peterson from ""The Donna Reed Show""), they do their best to conserve the food and fight against mutants (why are there ALWAYS mutants?).Despite mutants and nuclear war and a stripper and her evil (and horny) boyfriend, Buchanan manages to make a film that seems about 20 minutes too long. The pacing is like lead and the film is so cheaply made that there really are never any thrills or excitement. While not among the very worst films I have seen, it's definitely close and only of interest to bad movie fans.This film was recently released along with another Buchanan 'classic'--IT'S ALIVE. Both are excruciatingly terrible films, but somehow IT'S ALIVE manages to provide a small amount of entertainment--something IN THE YEAR 2889 never even comes close to doing.",True

However there were quite a few flaws that didn't quite kill the movie, but if these flaws weren't present who knows how good it could have been? For example I think Crazy Steve is one of if not they funniest character in Drake & Josh and while he did appear in the movie, he wasn't that funny. The actor plays ""Spencer"" in ICarly and he is much funnier in that. Also some the jokes that were clearly meant to be HYSTERICAL were just stupid.

But you'll drown in malarkey before you find anything truthful or worth speculating about in THE 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT, a no-budget movie that is trying to close the barn door after all the horses and jihadists have escaped.Writer-director Leigh Scott is obviously a concerned American citizen who wanted to enlighten audiences on what the 560-page report might reveal. It would help if his movie had actors, instead of a guy who looks like David Duchovny, a chick who looks like Gina Gershon, a guy who thinks he's Russell Crowe and another guy who I'm pretty sure is trying hard to be Sean Bean. It would help if his camera operator didn't have Parkinson's; if the lighting director wasn't trying to save on electricity; it would help if his editor didn't have Attention Deficit Disorder, or if the soundtrack wasn't some tuneless new world order esoterica; and the looping should have probably been inserted when people were actually moving their mouths.We can't even call this propaganda. It's too funny. And by funny, I mean unwatchable.You can't squeeze an issue this complex into a two-hour film, but Leigh Scott tries anyway, including all those sexy catch-phrases we've grown inured to: bin Laden's intent to attack, purchasing weapons from Somalia, non-aggression agreement with Iraq, Mussawi attending flight school, weapons of mass destruction...The problem is: we know it's all retrospect, so every discussion the concerned intelligence operatives have with each other reeks of fake hindsight all crammed into a neat conversation. ***Like contrived reverse engineering, everything pertinent is mentioned*** succinctly so that we can shake our heads in wonder at how incompetently all these branches of government screwed up.There's a ludicrous interrogation scene with a lubricious bimbo beating up on a guy with tomato sauce on his face. Now - that would be considered torture if most guys didn't consider it a turn-on.The tagline is: ""What if the attack could have been stopped?"" By this movie's account - and, we presume, according to the Commission Report - the CIA and other underground agencies were all set to capture bin Laden and didn't. Everyone involved with the ""terrorism"" reports (you mean you actually read these reports?) is so concerned we just want to slap them for their bad acting.Yet the whole story goes so much deeper than the banal soundbytes the negligent Ku Bush Klan foisted on the American people after 9/11. We now know that even capturing bin Laden before the 9/11 attack would not have changed or achieved anything - the wheels were in motion with or without that Taliban figurehead whose involvement was the possible figment of someone's fevered imagination to unite America against a common enemy. Contrary to popular belief ""they"" didn't ""attack us."" As Ron Paul tried to elucidate, it was a case of Middle Eastern blowback - ""they"" were so sick of America planting their infidel feet ""over there"" that they brought the war ""over here."" So though George W. Death likes to tout the nonsensical, ""We're fighting them over there so we won't have to fight them over here,"" in reality ""Because we're Over There, the fight has been brought Over Here."" The 9/11 attack was not so much about the intricate planning of terrorists, as it was the gross negligence of the Bush administration, who we know (without the probing of Commissions) had all the intel from the Clinton administration onwards; information about terrorist cells reaching critical mass and their intent to cause chaos. But the Oil Idiot of Texas, who refused to read his Daily Briefings and would rather vacation at his Crawford ranch than spend one extra day at work, abrogated the duty he swore an oath to perform - protect the American public.And then the scum who called himself president used the attacks brought about by his negligence as a political hammer against his own dumbed-down countryfolk to score a second term, shred the American Constitution and take America into a Fake War on the basis of a lie (WMD), with a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. Strangely enough, the movie never treads near the Ku Bush Klan, offering no opinion or judgment, Leigh Scott wanting to remain neutral. Tell that to the raped and pillaged hundreds of thousands in the Fake War on Terror in Iraq.Out of pure coincidence, I realized I was watching this DVD while wearing my ""Bush lied. Thousands Died."" t-shirt.",True
95571,26 December 2008,SeanDTheFilmMaker,Valkyrie (2008),10.0,"This was a hauntingly suspenseful film. Though we all know the outcome of the events that took place, you still hold your breath as the events unfold. I haven't felt ***like this about a film since ""13 days"" never realizing (as I wasn't there) how close things really came! The whole cast was powerful, that being said*** I felt that it could have been a little longer. I wish the film spent more time with Tom's character so we could know a little bit more about him but with the screen time he had he made it clear that their were two sides. Those who wanted to over throw Hitler and where Men of action and those who just wanted to sit around talking about doing it. It is clear that Tom's character was driven by taking action, just wished we knew a little bit more about him.After the film my friend and I were debating on what parts of the story were true or what was embellished. Im very certain the characters kids playing the record ""Flight of the Valkarie"" was completely fictionalized and even a bit out of place, or perhaps too obvious would be the best choice of words. However that was my only real complaint to the makers of the film. Other than that it was really well done and have a pretty good feeling that the story will stick with me for a long time. Cause lets face it, these conspirators REA-A-A-L-Y came close to pulling it off. I was actually surprised at how close they got to winning and over throwing Hitler. I could just recall something about the bomb going off and the table top was the only thing that saved him back when they were telling me about this in High school. Even then a bit of curiosity sparked in my mind but that was it.This film really flushed everything out and shed some light and give a ""wider scope"" on the people of Germany and ***like the trailer said*** ""To show the world that we are not all like him"" Its definitely a film to be proud of.",True
95963,27 December 2008,WeGetIt,Site Specific: Shanghai 04 (2005),10.0,"Just finished watching this 13 minute film. I saw a couple of minutes of the others like Las Vegas and another one that had a beach in it. But The Shanghai was the only one I saw all the way through. I thought it was genius.I think what the creator did was absolutely genius on so many levels. Most obviously are the incredible shots of the city which very few of us would ever get to experience in our lives. The shots, editing, sound-scape, are all of great beauty and artistry. the shots speak for themselves, anyone can enjoy them and will no doubt find them beautiful.The most powerful thought I had while watching this film was how the director managed to make a film about whatever the viewer wants to see: either absolutely nothing or everything there is in the world. You might only see the city shots or you might find yourself thinking about the people who live there, government, art, history, effects of man on nature, etc etc. You can see the beauty of human hands molding the earth to their will and conquering the elements. And all this is so far away that it is like we are aliens passing by earth.The Shanghai film doesn't have any out of focus shots like the other films, i liked that about it. Also it used a Chinese song called ""The Orient is Red"" very ingeniously, adding a lot to this film.I just have to say that i think this is a win for the director, he has showed us a new way to look at the world and a new potential (or a lost one) of cinema. Bravo. ***Like Tarkovsky said*** ""Waht is true is always hard to understand"".",True
95983,27 December 2008,rmax304823,His Girl Friday (1940),8.0,"I think there are three versions of this play kicking around out there and this one is the best, not to mention the fastest.The director, Howard Hawks, was always good at light comedy, improvising gags on the spot and taking all sorts of liberties with the script. Sometimes the plot got lost along the way (""The Big Sleep"") but he was always a superb story teller.Hildy Johnson, Rosalind Russell, is an ace reporter about to marry a dull insurance salesman, Ralph Bellamy, but her editor wants to keep her on the paper. Cary Grant couldn't have been a better choice for the role of Walter Burns, Hildy Johnson's editor. He's handsome and roguish and lies with every breath he takes.Hawks rewrote the play. In the original, Hildy was a man but Hawks, who never quite got his gender roles straight, heard a talk-through and decided it would be more interesting if Hildy were a woman. And that enabled the writers to introduce the jealousy element, which wouldn't have fit the original story unless we're talking homoeroticism.I felt kind of sorry for Ralph Bellamy's character. Even his name -- Bruce Baldwin -- sounds like the noise a foot might make when it's being pulled from sludge. The poor guy is earnest, sincere, highly principled, and lives with his mother in Albany. He's the kind of man that every woman in the 1930s wanted to build a home with -- a beastly impulse in itself -- only they'd have to get rid of mother first. Ground glass in the Pablum perhaps.That mother is a real pain in the neck too. She's supposed to accompany them on the overnight train to Albany and travel with them on their honeymoon. Burns traps the feisty old lady into some contretemps and tells his goon, Louie, ""Take her down to Polack Mike's and tell the cops she was plastered,"" or something like that.Try putting a line like that into a politically correct movie today. Polack Mike's. Notwithstanding the fact that the Polish word for Polish people is ""polaki."" The movie rises into the surreal once in a while. The assembled reporters, when they're not playing poker in the press room, speak in headlines. They call their editors with stories that can't possibly be printed. If additional guards will be placed around the scaffold during Earl Williams' hanging, the lead is ""Sheriff just adds new family members to city payroll."" Roger Ebert, a Chicago newsman himself, took some pleasure in seeing how much things had changed since the 1920s, but the change was to be expected. The eternal verities aren't very eternal when you get right down to it. When I was a kid, every car looked ***like it had been made in 1939, the mass was said*** in Latin, and you could supposedly look up girls' dresses by covertly glancing at their patent leather shoes. Now -- it's all changed. And where did it go? (Sob.) Kleenex, please. Thank you.What an enjoyable and funny movie this is. Oh, it creaks at the joints, but that's to be expected because it's so old. It's like Cary Grant talking Ralph Bellamy into writing out Grant's insurance policy with Rosalind Russel as the beneficiary. Bellamy objects a bit because he wants to provide for her all by himself. But what if he can't? ""Can't you just imagine Hildy when you're gone? Sitting on the porch swing? Old lace and lavender?"" Bellamy says dreamily, ""Yes, I can."" Grant stands back and snaps, ""She's OOOOLD, isn't she!"" I can't stop laughing at the irreverence.",True
96061,5 September 2020,Horst_In_Translation,Mamas Flitterwochen (2008 TV Movie),2.0,"""Mamas Flitterwochen"" is a German television film from 2008, so this film is already over a decade old. The director is Thomas Jacob and one of the writers is Andy T. Hoelzel. There is not too much to say about those two. They are both retired now and their filmographies are made up of really weak movies like this one here. So it is pretty impossibly to be surprised because of the quality here. Or lack of quality I should say. The seccond writer is Ina Siefert. She was still younger when this was made, so is still active nowadays, however, not as a writer, but in her main profession as a composer. This film we have here has not credited a composer, but my guess is that she was doing the score for this film as well, which, if true, shows me that she has not only no talent in writing, but also no talent in composing with the really bad music here, especially in those moments when we see the female protagonist feel dizzy or even collapse and hear the equivalent of a Jaws soundtrack basically going all in full drama etc. Cringeworthy stuff. Maybe it was meant to attract attention away from the actress' acting, weak acting there, but honestly it brought out just the worst in both aspects. The actress is Ruth-Maria Kubitscher, who is really old now and has been in the industry for many decades and the fact that late in her career she still has to show up in movies like this, says nothing positive about her at all. Sure the script brings her down too, but nobody forced her to agree to be a part of this project. And also she is far from good, actually I wonder if she was equally bad in the 70s or so. The husband to her character here is played by Austrian Ernst Stankovski, who was/is even older, now in his 90s, but also now retired for almost a decade. Well, what can I say about him. He is not good either here, but not terrible I guess. The script brings everybody down. This also includes the younger actors and actresses especially. The women are more known than the men I suppose. Susanna Simon and Tina Ruland you have probably come across if you care about German film and television, the latter especially in terms of Simon. Both are over 50 know, were around the age of 40 back then and have been part of many projects. But this is also a case of quantity over quality for both of them. They are not good actresses and the way Ruland entered the film industry says it all. She has not gotten any betteer, just a different kind of crappy. Anyway, another thing that needs to be said is that this film is part of a trilogy, actually the third chapter and with all the time passed since then, it is good to be safe that there will be no fourth movie ever. Of course, they also had to deal with some stuff from the previous two films here ***like one actress apparently would not return for this film, so they just said*** her character left the country. Good decision from her in any case. Still, I must say that one film is already one film too many if the level is as low as it is here. A truly horrible film.I will give you a few examples of scenes and inclusions that made it obvious that this is a really poor film. However, first of all I have to mention Kubitschek again. I have seen her in other films too and sometimes I went easy on her that it was just the material that sucked and not her performance, but after seeing this film (and the first from the trilogy too), there is no way I can say she is a good actress. Probably not even a mediocre actress. Okay, now about this film in specific: The dialogue writing was a gigantic mess to be honest. Extremely bad from beginning to end. Just two examples: One character has a business meeting with a group of Asian investors or something and she makes the most randomly embarrassing reference about the upcoming Olympic Games. But the worst moment 100% in terms of the dialogues is when one character has a conflict with another and he simply responds with a general wisdom about cleaning one's home. That was so embarrassing. I am not sure if this was supposed to be meant in a metaphoric or symbolic way, but it just went all kinds of wrong and the moment they were going for depth and significance here is the moment it all goes wrong. Of course, Kubitschek's character is also such a strong and independent woman that she explains in the end to her man that she did not want to talk about her illness because she would not be appreciated anymore or only for reasons of sympathy. Sigh. Cringe is real. The film already starts fairly low with the marriage between them, but this is still tolerable compared to the conflict out of nowhere briefly later hen Kubitschek's character is not ready to go on a six-week cruise ith her new husband. And let me not even get started about the bed stories between them earlier. What else? Oh yes, the daughters, two of them, also get their new cringe stories. One has to do with the female all of a sudden working and the male staying at home to be a dad and the switched trditional roles resulting in conflicts between the two, while the other has a story of a man so desperate at becoming the legal dad for a baby, but all these conflicts are declared irrelevant in the end when everybody realizes they should not have focused too much on themselves, but instead been there for the old lady. Of course. Needless to say that the stroke she suffers from has no long-term consequences and her brain is alright and what is her reaction when she finds out? ""I know"" Okay, not full of herself at all. Then again, the miraculous old lady surely could have been a neuroscientist if she wanted to in her life, that is how amazing she is. Oh yeah, there's also talk and action linked to changing the house, going alternative energy, installing a satellite on the roof etc. that the elderly lady is not happy about at all and even will get physically in the way of the construction crew. Before she collapses in the most dramatic fashion. This shall be all then. There is no talent in this film at all, no matter which perspective you take, also it is as anti-male a these German small screen releases by ARD Degeto frequently are and the additional inclusion of Ziegler Filmproduktion makes things only worse. Two minuses do not make a plus this time. Not at all. It rather feels like 200 minuses and if I gave 1 out of 10 rating, then I'd certainly do it here. Highly not recommended!",True

97086,9 December 2019,LnineB,仲夏魘 (2019),8.0,"This is by far the best horror film I've seen in the past five or so years. I've actually seen it three times since it's release and will watch it again shortly after buying the extended version.This film isn't perfect. It could actually be a bit too long and the middle sequence after the mid-act climax is WAY too long for such an intense climax. With that said, there are a few things that completely make you forgive those mistakes.1. Florence Pugh's performance : She's absolutely amazing and captures the intricate details of a person's psyche after experiencing a traumatic event. Her performance also justifies her actions later in the film. We are constantly reminded that she is broken and fragile. In that state she could be easily manipulated and should'e been nurtured instead of patronized.2. The first sequence, Mid-climax and finale. ***Like I said*** earlier the parts in between these sequences are a bit too long but these scenes are masterful, especially the build-up to the middle sequence. Aster reminds us , in the beginning of this film , that TRUE horror comes in the form of depression, suicide, murder and supreme lost of a loved one. The beginning scene is almost too much to watch, especially if you've experienced similar horrific acts. The Mid-Climax is just simply horrific. There's nothing symbolic about it. It's just something that you almost don't want to see ever again. The ending is tamer in comparison to the first two sequences but it does successfully wraps up a surreal experience in the most perfect way.3. The cinematography: The beginning of the film is dark and appropriate for the theme,but the rest of the film, almost 2-1/2 hours of it , is represented in a wash of light and colors. It literally looks TOO perfect , of which is exactly the feeling you should get once you meet the cult. By the end of the film the light and colors become annoying. Too me that's a good thing, because, also by then, you are finding out how horrific of a setting the land is. This is a perfect way carrying out a concept through the details of a film.4. The deeper meaning: This is of course my interpretation but the deeper meaning of this film makes it a masterpiece. I've seen reviews saying that the film is unrealistic and that there is NO story or mystery in the film. I actually think the exact opposite. it's unrealistic to some because it's an analogy of something that is very REAL . The complete disconnect we as humans have with trauma is represented clearly in this film. The story to me is about this disconnect with trauma or the lack of meaningful relationships. This is the reason someone can be drawn to cults or negative influences. The supporting characters in this film represent the everyday reactions and responses to horrific trauma by a lot of people today (ie thoughts and prayers). The main character represents the person that is truly grieving and is often left alone or made to think that their grieving is actually wrong. To me this analogy makes this film VERY realistic and actually more scary than other horror films.I absolutely loved this film and can't wait to watch the extended version of it. It's the well crafted, thought provoking, type of horror that we need in this day and time. 8/10",True

To review, we figure out that Dr. Manhattan plays god by creating Adam and Eve but becomes indifferent as they worship him. The origin of the clones with Adrien is revealed.In westworld, the hosts have cornerstones. We basically figure out the cornerstone of Manhattan constantly falling in love. After all, he did use to be a man.Adrian's prison is what we thought it was and not something more than that. There were various theories debunked. It was of course manhattan who was the only one who create such a prison after all. A prison that was meant to be a paradise. A paradise for a plan A that made Jon unaware of who he was to save his relationship with angela.Another series that I watch is black mirror. Its reoccurring song by Irma Thomas, ""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is"", makes a cameo. Could it have been foreshadowing tragedy since in black mirror or constantly ends that way? Hell yes.We also get a first hand impression of how manhattan is all over time. Futur and past simultaneously. How he able to manipulate events of the future with question basically is the main twist of the episode.........end review.The show is brilliant and I believe theres a bubble of people hypersensitive about it. Theyre tired of recreations of their childhood with political and social agendas. Star wars, batwoman, Ghostbusters, Charlie's Angel's, Captain Marvel.This show, un***like the examples I mentioned***, has great writing.

97903,10 December 2019,tkaine3,The Head Hunter (2018),9.0,"The thing about great movies isn't just about one aspect it has to combine the elements well enough that each of them seperately can hold their own respectively. The storyline, The acting, The look, The pacing and directing. You want everything to mesh well and not stick out like a sore thumb for lack of a better word and be the one element that holds a project down when it could of lifted off.
Now for all intents and purposes that element and aspect for this film ""The Head Hunter"" should and in 99% of all cases would be the shoe string budget of around 30K. Now whether that's in Euros or my slightly watered down American green backs it still isn't getting you too far when it comes to producing a film worthy enough for todays
everyone in the world now is a super duper TV watching who cares about Siskel and Ebert they know nothing critics who I myself am apart of world where indie films don't get watched if they are too subpar. But beyond the fact that early on you may have wanted to see more action and figured the budget couldn't cut it but then later realized it was sort of tucked away perfectly to make later scenes that much more dramatic, It just really shows the effort and ingenious put behind such a beautifully shot feature with elegant dreary and dark scenes that blended so well with the over all feel of this feature I am ***like another reviewer stated***, literally blown away. Definitely the best small budget under 100K flick I've ever seen. And I've seen quite a bit, most of'em I couldn't make it all the way through but atleast I've attempted quite a bit.. KUDOS to those involved for this one the awards are well deserved.. I'll be looking for future endeavors.",True

98109,22 February 2016,mbh42498,Teen Titans (2003–2006),10.0,"It's hard to give a kids' show 10/10. Why? Because its generally made for kids; that's the logic. However, this show isn't just for kids, as I realized when it aired, just as I do now watching online. The show can get goofy at times revolving around the green character, but the rest can be just as serious as any other superhero show. Teen Titans is similar to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (No, not the original series, and DEFINITELY NOT like the 2012 version. The series that aired in 2003, ironically the same year Titans was made). Similar animation style, villains, fighting, more comedy, but no little romance. Titans doesn't throw the love in your face, but when it does, you feel the full force of it. These characters have little to hate about them, so its really hard to not want to see them together.Now to get to the main theme of this show; the action sequences. Titans is a cartoon and there are brief times when you are able to see the cartoonish style of attacks. It's not as drastic as Tom and Jerry where if a character got flattened, they'd continue to walk flat until springing back to normal. The use of cartoon fun is meant to add to the show, something that Batman and Green Lantern shows lack because they are deep and dark. Titans has both those aspects to it at times, but still doesn't lose sight of who the intended audience is; kids. And ***like I said*** before, the cartoon animations are only brief, and do not make you feel like you're watching something along the lines of Spongebob.With that said, I loved how much this show's softer moments relate to viewers. Batman= dark, drastic, hero. Iron Man= billionaire, genius. Teen titans= heroes who STILL have to struggle with their hormones and personalities as teenagers. Some of the issues that they face are topics that we discuss still to this day. And what gets me is how moving some of the dialogue exchanges during these scenes are. Soon after a few episodes a viewer is already growing on their characters.Let's not forget the caliber cast assembled to play these heroes. I'm very satisfied with the choices for each character on this show, especially the main ones. Tara Strong, Hynden Walch, and Greg Cipes always find their way into cartoons, and I was so glad to see them take on a show that is more susceptible to be eaten up by more keen critics. Ron Perlman and Ashley Johnson also have reputable resumes (Hellboy and The Last of Us, respectively). Many people might've gotten sick of Spongebob's voice, but it's much more difficult to hate on voice actors like these guys.I just wish this show was much longer than 65 episodes, because the series was and still is in a higher league. Such a shame though that this show was ""revived"" with Teen Titans Go, because that show is 50 notches under par compared to this show, even if it is for younger children.",True
98559,23 February 2016,marcin_kukuczka,"The Forsyte Saga: Action for Libel (1967) Season 1, Episode 21",8.0,"After the dramatic, unfortunate evening when symptoms of the age became too strong to handle, the dramatization in this episode draws wonderful parallels between characters. In spite of being sued for libel, they all share some specific reluctance. The episode begins with an unwanted gift and ends with an unwanted encounter...Soames, now 69, follows the advice of Jack Cardigan (Andrew Armour), his niece's husband, the embodiment of 'being fit' trend and takes up golf. He accepts this unwanted gift from Jack, clearly reluctantly but with a truly Forsyte-like priority: never give up. In spite of failures, he goes on... And all would, perhaps, develop in the most desirable way if it were not for the unfortunate, sudden, unexpected telegram that his sister Winifred (Margaret Tyzack) brings.Much will have to be centered on controversy or rather discrepancy between 'what everybody knows' and 'what everybody tells.' The fuss around Marjorie Ferrar (Caroline Blaskiston) and the means for the unwanted but, for honor's sake, inevitable action are the aspects we truly need to pay attention to. An allegedly scandalous book titled CANTHAR already published in Belgium but still censored in Great Britain seems to draw parallel to the character of a woman who 'has morals about her.' The tricky business is how to distribute the copies of the book...Here comes the young and ambitious but seriously harmed by fate, Butterfield (Donald Gee) - remember Elderson's case within the PPRS - a man with a persuasive tongue who will distribute the copies of the highly immoral book which may make you burst with curiosity as for its content but which reveals the innate caution that Marjorie displays. Caution while everybody else seems to be absorbed by emotions...Marjorie Ferrar becomes the center of attention not only due to a truly new 'type of woman' not at all old fashioned but really a modern one (even to our today's perspectives) within the story and characters haunted by the Victorian period but due to the way she is perceived by men. Two men namely who love Marjorie: the 'American Prince Charming' Francis Wilmot (Hal Hamilton) and a strong gentleman of old manners and a cutting tongue, Sir Alexander MacGown (John Phillips). There is a growing dramatic tension within the young farmer from South Carolina who will have much to suffer until he decides to quit and be finished with that 'fool business.' Sir Alexander MacGown is a totally different personality. On the one hand, he cannot understand why he loves this 'hardest woman he has ever met' and, on the other hand, he grows intensely jealous of her. Yet, above all, she is not dependent of any of them. ***Like Nora Curfew mentioned***, she is a new type of woman admired by men and hated by some women. To make things worse, she is rumored to have had an affair with Aubrey Greene (John Bailey) - remember the painter who did paint the delicious naked girl Victorine Bicket...In that very context evokes the obstinate and selfish character of Fleur who, like her father, will never give up. In spite of the various feelings and emotions that arise within the political situation of Great Britain (Tony Gains wins the election) and Michael's serious contribution and commitment to the new phenomenon/policy called foggatism where he has a vision full of prospects (consider the excellent scene of his speech described as ""lively and well delivered""), the rivalry does not resort to women who called themselves names but spreads to men. There is a brilliant scene of humour and drama when MacGown attacks Michael in the male 'room.' His jealousy displays at the political level and rivalry therein. Poor nose...John Phillips is very good in the role.Within all that new reality that Galsworthy develops within the context of Great War's effect on people, young people, there is also room for sentimentality in the episode. Old servant of the family, Smither (Maggie Jones) turns up unexpectedly at the Forsytes' and Winifred accepts her request for employment. Minor as the scene may seem, it is a very important touch of the past that seemingly, only seemingly did not matter at the time. Here, it hows the bright side of Winifred's character and the scene is beautifully played, highly worth consideration.Unfortunately, we do not get Marjorie's father, Marguess (George Benson) in the episode. He is always a great delight for a viewer awaiting magnificent performance and brilliant humour. But the drama seems to reach its climax in the final scene and the truly unwanted encounter of Fleur and Marjorie at Langham Hotel. There, actually, for the first time we see the true face of Fleur. Desperate, ill Francis, unlike many Americans, quits and is finished with that fool business having realized that there is someone else in Marjorie's life and the women? Any continuity or sense of service? Reaction to the rival will find its realization in the courtroom...",True
98805,23 February 2016,drmankin777,Diablo (2015),1.0,"***Like the taglines said***: This movie is Beyond Hope. Beyond Salvation. However, there's plenty of regret on our part for watching it. This was a really bad movie. Just awful. Not one bit entertaining. Bad acting, bad directing, bad writing.Do I have to justify the one star when it clearly deserves zero? Okay, the scenery was absolutely beautiful. So gorgeous in fact, that after I finish this review, I'm going to Google where it was filmed. There, done. That was the only good thing about the movie. Now back to this atrocious pile of garbage. Not much more I can say after reading some of the other reviews. Everyone who said it was garbage nailed it. Unfortunately, I rented it from a Redbox before looking at the reviews. In one scene, our ""hero"" was out in the open, when he sees some movement in the nearby woods. He just stands there watching for a while with a stupid, I mean, puzzled look. And to our surprise, oh my gosh, he gets shot! So two ""bad guys"" are in the cover of the woods, on horseback, and they have their weapons drawn, and they just shot this guy (and his horse by the way). So our ""hero"" moves towards his weapon - which is not on his person. So, hmmm, do the ""bad guys"" in the cover of the woods with their weapons already drawn finish the job? No, they say something to the affect that ""he is going for his weapon..."", AND THEY RUN!What the heck? They run? Did that really just happen? I just can't get my head around how bad this scene was! Who writes garbage like this? Who directs garbage like this? Who in the world green lights garbage like this? Inconceivable!Then there were the numerous scenes throughout this gem where nobody could hit the side of a barn! It was like a western version of the old TV series ""The A-Team"" where 10,000 bullets were fired, and nobody got shot! Okay maybe not that bad. But this is the old west, where people were trained with weapons because their life depended on it. And there were shootouts where people couldn't hit the side of a barn WITH A RIFLE! Are you kidding me? You are in handgun range with a rifle and you miss???So, yes this movie was bad, but at least the horrifically revolting ending quickly brought it from the trash to the gutter. I don't know what to say about the ending. I actually laughed out loud at the absolute absurdity of the ending. It was just so appropriate for how bad the movie had been all along. Do yourself a favor. Forego this waste of your time, and grab a CLINT Eastwood western and enjoy.",True
98889,23 February 2016,aharmas,Murder by Death (1976),9.0,"I have loved this movie for the longest time. Where else can you find? Maggie Smith, Peter Sellers, David Niven, Alec Guinness, Nancy Walker, and other great stars playing the most famous movie detectives in the world. There are all kinds of jokes and most of them are really funny.All of the main characters are invited to solve the ultimate murder crime, and each of them is also possibly the star of the celebration. All kinds of strange events happen, and all of the confusing trickery that one can find in the different bestsellers is fair game. It's indeed a riot to see Guinness doing broad comedy, and the dry humor of both Niven and Smith is a joy to behold. Peter Falk is hilarious as he exchanges lines with his ""girlfriend"", and there is nothing P.C. about Seller's treatment of his adopted son, but it's another decade, and people can't help but at least give a shocked reaction to how comedy evolves through the year.Back then, they were aiming for big laughs, and sometimes the jokes worked. Much depends on chemistry, acting, and being familiar with the style of the writers and the inspiration for the characters. It's not sophisticated but quite creative and ***like I said*** before a page of times long gone when you were treated to spectacles and productions with many stars who were willing to celebrate an art, tell a story, or in this case, tell a good joke.""Murder by Death"" will live on forever because it is like a photo album, telling a story, showing a snapshot of a time long gone, a series of scenes when the actors winked at you as they had a ball.Four stars!!!",True
98935,24 February 2016,EzioMonty117,Deadpool (2016),10.0,"I saw Deadpool With high expectations, i've been a fan of the character since the video game where i first knew about the character, the Comics were pretty good too but i haven't read a lot of it, and when i heard they announced a Deadpool Movie, i just screamed in joy, i saw the Movie a week after it's release and here is my thoughts.The story is predictable but not bad. A former Special Forces operative now mercenary named Wade Wilson likes doing crime and being a villain, but one day in a bar, he meets Vanessa and they instantly fall in love, until one day, Wade collapses to the floor and the next day, he finds out that he is diagnosed With thermal cancer and that he will have a few days of survival, but a recruiter at the bar he goes to says he can give him Powers and Cure the cancer. Wade agrees and is sent to a facility where People get their Powers, the leader of the facility Ajax (villain) tortures Wade and straps him up to a machine, the machine while giving him Powers, made his face disfigured and burnt, his New Powers are regenerating Health and invincibility, now Wade must seek revenge on Ajax for both making his face disfigured and for stealing his girlfriend, so Wade becomes Deadpool With the help of Weasel and Al, old lady, and he Slices his way through the city of Vancouver to get to Ajax and fulfill his revenge With help by Colossus and Negasonic teenage warhead.Ryan Reynolds in this Movie is absolutely stunning, he is the Perfect Choice for Deadpool and his wit and sophistication is wonderful. The characters are pretty good too, while Ajax is a bland villain, i really liked Weasel and especially Al, they're both funny supporting characters and they will never be forgettable. Even Dopinder is a great character, i would have liked if he had a bigger role, but he is still a great character.The film's main selling point is the humor and is also one of the film's strengths, the humor is near Perfect With a lot of in-jokes, fourth wall humor from Deadpool, pop culture References, Visual humor and vulgar humor, all of them work, even the jokes that suck are pretty good, because they are supposed to be bad on purpose, which makes the humor even better.The Source material is top notch, everything from the fourth wall humor and the characters is very like the Comics, this is one of those Comic book films, where it follows the Comic book perfectly. The action scenes are spectacular, some of the best i've seen in years, they're fast and very gory and profane, the scene where Deadpool shoots Three guys With one bullet is some of the best piece of action ever put into film, it's absolutely marvelous.The film isn't by any means Perfect, the story ***like i said*** earlier is predictable and the origin story feels kinda rushed compared to the Comics, and the villain is bland and forgettable, and sometimes the jokes can wear off, but other than that, the film is amazing.The climax and post credits scene is amazing, the climax is funny and exciting and leaves you wondering and the post credits scene is especially awesome, since they're Deadpool tells the audience that there is gonna be a Deadpool sequel featuring Cable and making jokes about actors and films along the way, so excited for the sequel.Deadpool is one of the funniest and exciting films i've seen in years, it's ambition, humor, characters, Source material, action sequences and did i forget to mention, the soundtrack With Music by DMX and Salt n Pepa is pretty good, the story as well as it's origin story is predictable and the villain is bland and some jokes are a little clunky, but this film is Worth recommending, guaranteed.10/10 Btw, the film is very damn vulgar AF",True
98988,24 February 2016,The_Man_XX7,Deadpool (2016),9.0,"Deadpool was just...WOW, when i walked out of the cinema i just couldn't believe how good it was as it had a small budget,was small scale and the movie was short for a superhero movie, but that's what made it good you can clearly see the director,producers and cast did great with the material they had. First off the humor..oh my gosh my humor was great,Ryan Reynolds is there perfect choice even before this movie we knew that(X-Men Origins Wolverine) and the dude brings the character to life with his portrayal .Even from the opening credits this movie starts to make you laugh and the first 10 minutes of this movie has the is best opening scene in a superhero origin story because origin stories are usually slow paced then improve to a faster pace, but this movie starts off with a fast pace and even when Deadpool isn't shown you never get bored because of the crude,rude humor,one-liners and characters in this movie. The rest of the cast's performances were good as well as the chemistry between Ryan's Wade Wilson and Morena Baccarin's Vanessa was great, you bought the romance these two characters had,cared for their relation as it was a weird and odd relationship.Wade's Friend Weasel was also decent comic relief and the two X-Men characters Colossus and Megasonic teenage warhead(yeah) fit perfectly into this movie.The villain Ajax portrayed by Ed Skrien was actually good, this guy was a generic bad guy, but worked for this movie as he was a threat to Deadpool and people around him(and the guy was an a**hole). What made this movie different from other superhero movies is the R-rating, at first i wasn't sure about it because from the trailers i thought they would go over the top with the R-rating, but i was wrong as this movie was better because of it, the gore,violence and of-course language was right for this movie even with some very EXPLICIT scenes it never feels out of place.The action was great, again the R-rating makes the action better and how can you not love a movie that opens up with an action sequence and one more thing to point out is even if this movie was part comedy it had some small scenes where the movie grew dark and i was really surprised by this because it fitted well and the intensity was amazing. Now the BAD, this movie had a few bad things about it ***like we all know Deadpool isn't a superhero more antihero because the man is a clear and there was this whole subplot in the movie where they tried to make Deadpool be a proper hero but you know it couldn't work as the subplot was just unnecessary and pretty obvious also i pointed out*** that the movie has good humor there are some scenes whereby the humor feels out of place at specially whereby the movie is supposed to feel intense it just doesn't work.Then there are some annoying filler moments whereby they tried to rub some humor but just felt unnecessary and of-course with a small budget comes some bad CGI at times, but rather than that this movie is perfect. Deadpool is the perfect origin story for the character as the movie is funny,action packed,weird and just fun,the studio made up for that monstrosity in X-Men Origins Wolverine(they shut his mouth),didn't go over the top with the R-rating and the movie was just fun despite the small budget.Superhero fans with love this movie and non-superhero fans will have a good time-BRING ON DEADPOOL 2.",True

Last time I felt such a beautiful feeling was after watching Green Book. You are right. The Avengers do not move me, the DC does not allure me .

The fact that it is based on a true story makes you feel even more positive about the people around, about the hues of life, shades of grief.

Les miserables, prisoners and the greatest showman he is a good actor but this is not one of his great movies this is one of his worst movies and Jackman and Weisz have zero chemistry but you can actually laugh at the fact that they actually chose to work together on this crapfest but why is it because aronofsky wanted to return to directing and make creative art for a movie well he makes it poorly that is what kind of a terrible director he is a one who makes movies that are about art and weird disturbing imagery. I hated all of the charachters especially weisz's charachter she was really unlikeable and Weisz's acting was also bad her performance was likely a contendor for worst actress of the year I honestly wanted Izzy to die I hated her so much she was unlikeable and the scene were she dies is painful they try to revive her and Tom gets sad and complains all the time I was cheering for that tumor to kill her I was happy she died because it would have been the only way to end the movie but unfortunately it didn't because Tom later dreams about her like she is still alive but she isn't she is dead and then Tom turns into a plant and prays to the tree of life and it also has a bad ending and where he plants a fruit in izzys grave and this film also has a mix of science fiction because it has a scene were the tree of life dies into space and a spaceship arrives for its destination to experience the horror of toms vision this movie has the worst plot ever it is another terrible movie from Darren aronofsky i am surprised it didn't get razzie nominated it deserved razzie nominations for worst actress, worst director , worst picture and worst screenplay.
